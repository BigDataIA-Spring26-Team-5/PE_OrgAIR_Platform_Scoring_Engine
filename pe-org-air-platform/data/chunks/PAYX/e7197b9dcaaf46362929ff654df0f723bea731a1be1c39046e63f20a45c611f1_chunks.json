Business Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Paychex,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Paychex, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.

As of May 31, 2025, we served approximately 800,000 clients and their employees across the U.S. and parts of Europe. Paychex was incorporated in Delaware in 1979, maintains a corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and has a fiscal year that ends on May 31st. For any organization, a key function is effective human capital management, which requires resources and expertise. Organizations are faced with rapid evolution in employer-employee relations including: an increasing number and complexity of federal, state, and local regulations; changing workforce dynamics; and challenges attracting and retaining talent. Changing workplace dynamics reflect employees increasingly becoming mobile, working remotely, and expecting a user experience similar to consumer-oriented applications. We specialize in helping clients adapt to the rapidly evolving environment. Paychex offers a full range of integrated HCM solutions from hire to retire for businesses and their employees that enables customization to the clients' businesses, whether it is small or large, simple or complex.

We market our solutions through a combination of direct and virtual sales forces supported by various digital lead generation and multi-channel marketing initiatives. Over 50% of our revenues are from solutions other than payroll processing. On April 14, 2025, we completed our acquisition of Paycor HCM, Inc. (\"Paycor\"), a leading provider of HCM, payroll and talent software. The transaction aims to enhance the Company’s capabilities upmarket, expand its sales force and enhance its suite of AI-driven HCM solutions. 2 Table of Contents Company Strategy Our strategy is to be the digitally driven HR leader, serving as an essential partner to clients by providing them with the technology and advisory solutions they need for HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance.

The flexibility and scalability of our solutions enable our clients to select the best solution that meets their needs. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that generally do not contain specified contract periods and may be terminated by either party with 30-days’ notice of termination. We believe client retention is a useful indicator of client satisfaction with our solutions and support. For fiscal 2025, our client retention of Paychex clients was in the range of 82% to 83% of our beginning client base. Our Solutions We provide a unique blend of innovative technology solutions, backed by our extensive compliance and HR expertise, that help customers more effectively hire, develop, and retain top talent in this challenging workforce environment.

Sales and Marketing We market and sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force based in the markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes field and inside sales representatives who specialize within our portfolio of solutions. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, and various other demand generation programs. In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), benefit brokers, and banks for new client referrals. More than 50% of our payroll clients come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. Complementing our direct sales, our Embedded HCM Solution partnerships efficiently extend our distribution while providing a modern, holistic solution to customers. We also utilize digital marketing to promote our solutions. 5 Table of Contents We have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions ™ Program. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2027. We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations. We provide a free online portal, Paychex Partner Pro, designed to provide accountants quick access to critical data, reporting, and insights for their clients using Paychex Flex. This innovative portal transforms how CPAs manage their portfolios by providing a centralized hub for accessing client payroll and HR data, resolving issues, and identifying missing information, empowering them to operate with greater efficiency and proactivity in serving their clients. We also have long-standing relationships with health insurance and retirement benefits brokers, including large national partners. We recently launched the Partner+ Program to foster broker relationships and drive mutual growth. We now have a broader suite of solutions to offer brokers, which can supplement their offerings to clients, and the Partner+ Program provides a structured framework designed to safeguard mutual clients from competing products. In addition, our Partner Portal provides brokers exclusive access to advanced HCM solutions, new revenue streams, and data-driven insights.

Markets and Competition We remain focused on servicing clients based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Census data indicates that in the U.S., there are over 6 million employer firms in our target markets. The market for HCM solutions is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online payroll providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR solution providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. We believe our solutions also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement solutions companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs. Competition in the HCM industry is primarily based on the breadth of offerings, technology, ease of use, integration with third-party applications, service model, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. Our leading-edge technology and mobile applications, combined with personalized support provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled solution capabilities, differentiate us from our competitors. Software Maintenance and Development The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HCM solutions to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobile applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success. Human Capital We believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is critical to our future success and growth. We strive to foster a workplace that encompasses belonging and engagement and the ability to attract, retain, and develop talented employees; and keep them safe. We have dedicated resources to ensure that our efforts in building and sustaining a safe and inclusive culture are realized. 6 Table of Contents For detailed information regarding our human capital activities, we encourage investors to visit our Corporate Responsibility website page at https://www.paychex.com/corporate/corporate-responsibility. We have also made our Corporate Responsibility report available on our website. The information contained on our website and in our Corporate Responsibility report is not and should not be viewed as being incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Our Employees: As of May 31, 2025, we employed approximately 19,000 people, primarily in the U.S. and on a full-time basis. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Paychex Culture : Our core cultural values (“Paychex Values”) are designed to guide decision making aligned to the expectations of clients, stockholders, regulators, employees, and the multiple communities in which we operate and to reflect our continuing commitment to belonging and engagement. The Paychex Values are: Integrity Accountability Innovation Partnership Respect Service Each of these values guide our decision-making process and are critical to our ongoing success. All employees are required to verify their understanding and observance of these values during our annual “Right Way” training, review these values with management during periodic performance discussions, and are further encouraged to attend ongoing training during the year. Volunteer “Culture Champions” throughout the Company also help promote these values daily. We encourage employee feedback through our employee engagement surveys, as described below. This approach empowers our employees and allows us to make a positive impact in the communities we work and serve. As a result of our commitment to these principles, in 2025 we were recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. Paychex is one of only three companies to have achieved this recognition 17 times, doing so consecutively since 2012. Talent Acquisition and Development: We compete for talent along with our direct competitors and other companies in the geographic areas we serve. We invest significant resources to attract and retain top talent. Our Talent Acquisition team, in conjunction with certain third-party partners, has developed comprehensive processes to identify and recruit accomplished professionals. Once hired, our world-class Training Department provides functional training for service specialists and sales associates and also offers personal training, professional development, and leadership-development programs. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized as one of the top training organizations in the world by Training magazine. After four consecutive years ranking among the top ten, Paychex was inducted into the Training Hall of Fame in 2025. Comprehensive Compensation and Benefits: We are committed to providing a fair wage and a total rewards package that allows our employees to be their best in every area of their lives. We regularly review employee salaries to ensure we are competitive in the industry and offer financial benefits such as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, tuition assistance, scholarships for children of employees, and financial education. We are also committed to rewarding employees with a comprehensive, competitive benefits package, which includes medical, prescription, dental, and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, employee assistance program, paid family leave, and a variety of well-being programs. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 (“fiscal 2025”), compensation-related expenses accounted for approximately 55% of our total expenses.

Employee Well-being Initiatives: In addition to providing a comprehensive compensation and benefits package, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Healthier employees are at lower risk of injury from workplace related exposures, perform work more safely with lower rates of absenteeism, experience better job performance, and can live their lives more fully outside of work. Our well-being program is a robust program focusing on the physical, emotional, community, career, and financial health of our employees. 7 Table of Contents Our award-winning well-being initiatives offer a wide variety of services, tools, and resources that can help employees achieve their health goals using a holistic approach. In addition, we sponsor onsite health screenings, Red Cross blood donation events, flu vaccination clinics, vaping and tobacco cessation and weight management programs, meditation and yoga classes, and a variety of other programs. Our employees’ financial well-being is equally important, so we have developed programs for financial education and support. We maintain procedures for events such as fires, severe weather, medical emergencies, and active shooters, as well as other important information related to general workforce safety. In recognizing the ever-growing diversity of our workplace, we annually celebrate Paychex Culture Day. This is an additional paid day off for employees to celebrate and recognize a holiday that is significant to them. This is just one of the many ways we celebrate our employees’ unique heritages, and it reflects our Company's commitment to our staff. Employee Engagement : We regularly ask our employees to share their views on working at Paychex through company-wide engagement surveys. Facilitated internally by our Human Resources team, the survey methodology is periodically updated to reflect current trends and issues including company direction and strategy, inclusion, individual development, collaboration, and our Paychex Values. A third-party administers the survey to maintain confidentiality of responses. We use the survey responses to help inform management and assist in developing programs and policies that will maintain and promote Paychex Values. Intellectual Property We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us. Seasonality There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement solutions clients, and new worksite employees associated with our HR Outsourcing businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our solutions at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements. Available Information We are subject to the informational and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.

      "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors Our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. The following risk factors represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business. These are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect, possibly to a material extent, our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. In addition, refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K. Business and Operational Risks We may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our solutions and support. The market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changing industry standards. To maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to: enhance our current solutions and introduce new solutions in order to keep pace with solutions offered by our competitors, including the successful utilization of AI and machine learning solutions; enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements; and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards. We continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology. If our systems become outdated, it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality, time to market, cost and innovation relative to our competitors. The failure to provide a more efficient and user-friendly customer-facing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations. The failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools, natural language processing, and AI/machine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities. We may experience software defects, undetected errors, and development delays, which could damage our relationship with clients, decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability. Our solutions rely on software and computing systems, including generative AI solutions, that can encounter development delays, complexities with integrating new technologies, and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, bias, viruses, or defects. Defects in our solutions, errors or delays caused by our solutions and generative AI solutions not working as anticipated could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential clients, harm to our reputation and exposure to liability. In addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, bias, viruses, or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities or Internet disruptions. We rely upon information technology (“IT”) networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to support a variety of business processes, some of which are provided by third-party vendors. Cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation. A cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption or outage, corruption of data, or theft of personal or other sensitive information, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients, result in liability or regulatory sanction, or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The increasing velocity of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities, unintended data exposure, and Internet disruptions enabled by new and emerging technologies, such as advancements in AI and machine learning, may outpace our organization's ability to compete and/or manage the risk appropriately. In addition, threat actors may seek to engage in payment-related fraud or by more frequently attempting to gain access to our systems through phishing or other means. Furthermore, security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of threat actors and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. 9 Table of Contents Data Security and Privacy Leaks : We collect, use, and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients, employees of our clients, our employees, and other third parties, including: bank account, credit card, and social security numbers, tax return information, health care information, retirement account information, payroll information, system and network passwords, and other sensitive personal and business information. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile cyber and ransomware attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. We may be particularly targeted for cyberattack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect, use, and retain, as well as during and after periods in which we acquire other companies.

At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile cyber and ransomware attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. We may be particularly targeted for cyberattack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect, use, and retain, as well as during and after periods in which we acquire other companies. Vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Furthermore, if any of our solutions contain a software vulnerability, the vulnerability may be exploited to obtain access to our data or our clients’ data. Our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host. The security of our IT infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information. We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. While we have security systems and IT infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information, including our Cyber Fusion Center, if our security measures are breached, either internally or externally, our business could be substantially harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. Any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage, and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Third-parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security and reputational risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Data Loss and Business Interruption: If our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, the Company, our clients and employees of our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Hardware, applications, and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. Any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. The speed to closure of significant cybersecurity incidents may be influenced by the cooperation of governmental or law enforcement agencies. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of clients’ business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations. Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack or act of war, public health emergency, pandemic, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Climate-related weather disasters, including hurricanes, flooding, snowstorms, and severe rainstorms, could also threaten the business continuity of our operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, snowstorms, and rainstorms and has been successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients. If that were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 10 Table of Contents We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions. As part of providing services to clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. These third-party service providers include, but are not limited to, banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees, information technology vendors servicing cloud-based platforms, and other third-party providers supporting customer interactions. Failure by these service providers, or their respective outsourced providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us. We may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business. Many federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “co-employment” relationship within our PEO business. State and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and change with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will"

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business. Many federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “co-employment” relationship within our PEO business. State and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and change with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations. There is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. Although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws. Incurring additional liabilities related to our PEO business may adversely affect our results of operations. We may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends. Within our PEO business, we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees. We establish workers’ compensation insurance reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. The insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our PEO costs. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity, or our reserves were insufficient for claims activity, our costs could increase. In addition, in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms, if at all. Also, as a co-employer in the PEO, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities associated with health care reform and recent efforts by local, state and federal governments to deregulate, which may result in increased costs. Increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients. We may not realize the expected financial or business benefits from the Paycor acquisition. The integration of Paycor into our existing operations may present challenges aligning disparate technology platforms, operational systems, and may divert management’s attention away from day-to-day operational responsibilities to managing the integration. Compatibility issues may arise between our respective infrastructures, potentially delaying performance enhancements and straining our technical resources. Additionally, financial performance of acquired businesses may not meet pre-acquisition projections potentially affecting our consolidated results of operations, financial position and return on investment. While we have devised comprehensive strategies to address the integration complexities and maintain our strategic focus, the risks associated with unforeseen hurdles could affect our ability to achieve expected synergies and strategic growth targets. We made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Acquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities, and difficulties in integrating operations. Successful integration involves many challenges, including the difficulty of developing and marketing new solutions and support, our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the loss of key employees of an acquired business. The integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process. In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill, interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition, and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders. 11 Table of Contents If the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price. Financial Risks Our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf, resulting in financial loss to us. As part of our payroll processing solutions, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities. It is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them. We have in the past, and may in the future, make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed, resulting in loss to us. Similarly, our ability to operate our Purchased Receivable reporting unit is dependent on the ability of our clients' clients to remit their accounts receivable to us. If a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf or we are not able to collect purchased receivable balances, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or"

If a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf or we are not able to collect purchased receivable balances, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance. We receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact our interest income. Our debt obligations may expose us to risks affecting the operation of our business, and our failure to address these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In April 2025, we issued $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate corporate debt (“Corporate Bonds”). We used the net proceeds from this offering to fund our acquisition of Paycor. Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our Corporate Bonds. Our Corporate Bonds include certain covenants which may limit our ability to create liens on our assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or consolidate with another entity, subject to certain exceptions, limitations and qualifications as outlined in the Corporate Bond indenture. The Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the “Agreement”) that we entered into in January 2019 in connection with our acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P., also contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. These covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries (taken as a whole), certain merger transactions, certain sales of assets and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The Agreement, and the credit agreements providing for our credit facilities, also contain financial covenants, which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis, that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5:1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.0:1.0. In addition, certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20% of our consolidated stockholders’ equity. If we do not comply with these covenants, it could result in material adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition. Future acquisitions or transactions may bring us closer to the covenant thresholds previously outlined, potentially requiring further amendments to our credit facilities and debt obligations on less favorable terms. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments or to refinance our outstanding debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic, and other factors that are beyond our control, including those discussed in this Risk Factors section. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal and interest on any outstanding indebtedness. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which would also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more restrictive covenants. If we are unable to restructure or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if necessary, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. 12 Table of Contents Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our results of operations and lower our profitability. The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us a strong, investment-grade long-term debt rating. Our credit ratings depend on our performance and can also be impacted by events beyond our control, such as macroeconomic and/or political factors of the U.S. and global economy. Failure to maintain high credit ratings could increase the cost of short-term borrowing which would lower our profitability, reduce our ability to obtain short-term borrowing periodically required by our business, and adversely impact our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. Legal, Regulatory and Political Risks Our business, services, and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government laws and regulations. Many of our services, particularly payroll tax administration services, employee benefit plan administration services, and PEO services are designed according to government regulations that often change. Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. The addition of complex added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business. Our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. Our services are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the SECURE Act 2.0, data privacy regulations, and anti-money laundering rules. The growth of our international operations also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations.

The growth of our international operations also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations. The enactment of new laws and regulations, modifications of existing laws and regulations, or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business. Additionally, as federal, state, and international regulations become more complex, the risk that we may be unable to comply with those regulations increases, particularly in the event there are different or additional regulatory standards in different jurisdictions. Failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the areas of payment networks, health care reform and retirement plans as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base. Failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (as amended), which require us to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, and maintain transaction records, could result in civil and criminal penalties and adversely impact our business reputation. We are required to comply with regulations administered by multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide including, but not limited to, the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). OFAC places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons. A violation of a sanction or embargo program, or of the FCPA, or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations. Our reputation, results of operations, or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy and AI laws and regulations. Our solutions require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as geolocation and biometric data. Certain solutions are enhanced with the use of AI and machine learning. Our solutions are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels, including those governing personal privacy, AI and machine learning, as well as ethical considerations. In the U.S., we are or may be subject to, oversight by various regulatory authorities, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission and Department of labor. We must also comply with such laws as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (as amended). Additionally, we must also comply with federal and state labor and employment laws, and state data breach notification and data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, and biometric information privacy laws all as amended. Our European operations are subject to the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation. 13 Table of Contents Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We could be subject to litigation or reputational risk if we or our third-party providers fail to utilize data practices sufficient to safeguard proprietary, confidential, and personal or identifying information. The regulatory framework for privacy, AI, and machine learning issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of the use of AI tools, a cyberattack, or other wrongful conduct by employees or third-parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and solutions. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete. Third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights of AI algorithms and content generated by AI and we could become subject to similar claims of infringement as we expand our use of AI. To the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights with litigation, we could incur significant expenses and/or be required to pay substantial damages. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or vendors in connection with claims or litigation. The litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming.

The litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming. We are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and, as such, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees, or other costs. We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees, or other third-parties for various actions. From time to time, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct, and employment and labor law matters. The damages sought against us in some of these legal proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. General Risk Factors Our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by macroeconomic and/or political factors of the U.S. and global economy and such impact could be materially adverse. We and our clients are subject to the impacts related to inflationary pressure, economic instability, changes in interest rates, tariffs, potential instability of the banking environment, climate change-based obligations, and other macroeconomic and/or political events. Banking volatility may subject us and our clients to losses on uninsured funds and may make equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain, and additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Additionally, our business is substantially dependent on our clients’ continued use of our solutions and support, and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them. Our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions. If they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection, we may not be paid for solutions we already provided, and our client base will shrink, which will lower our revenue. If under financial pressure, our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the solutions and support we provide, which would reduce our revenue. Our clients may decrease their workforce, which would decrease their demand for our solutions. Because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry, we may face pricing pressure on our solutions and challenges in onboarding new clients, which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations. Furthermore, if the third-party service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients, our operations could be materially disrupted, and we could face significant penalties or liabilities. 14 Table of Contents We may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment. Trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability. Additionally, instability in the banking environment may adversely affect our business. These conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business. Further, inflation and uncertainty about tariff implementation may negatively impact our business and/or our clients' business, raise costs and reduce profitability. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing solutions. In addition, new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit. We invest our funds held for clients in high quality, investment-grade marketable available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, money markets, and other cash equivalents. We also invest our corporate funds in short- to intermediate-term instruments. Funds held for clients and corporate investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility and inflationary pressure. The interest we earn on funds held for clients and corporate investments may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest or lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds. If we are unable to reinvest our AFS securities when they mature, our interest income earned and investment portfolio would be reduced. If we sell AFS securities to satisfy short-term funding requirements, we may recognize losses, which would further reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings. Historically, we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. However, should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. Growth in customizable funding solutions offered to our clients by the purchasing of their accounts receivable through non-recourse arrangements, including funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry, may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited. In addition, our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited. See also “Item 7A.

Item 1B. Unr esolved Staff Comments None. 15 Table of Contents Item 1C. Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and information. Our security program is intended to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats, and is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Version 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”). The NIST CSF provides a flexible model for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. Our security infrastructure uses a layered controls approach, incorporating various capabilities guided by the NIST CSF and other industry standards and best practices. We routinely invest in our security processes and capabilities, including those related to our risk management and assessment programs, vulnerability and intrusion detection, incident response plans, and other advanced detection, prevention, and protection capabilities. We conduct regular assessments of cybersecurity risks to identify threats to us and potential vulnerabilities that could negatively affect our business operations if exploited. We track cybersecurity risks within our enterprise risk management system with cybersecurity threats considered to be among the top-priority risks to us. In addition, our Enterprise Security Organization (the “ESO”) conducts technical risk assessments, and, in some instances, we engage with third-party experts to assist with or perform technical risk assessments. The results of these risk assessments are reported to management. Our processes require escalation of significant cybersecurity risks to management and Paychex’s Audit Committee derived from the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The ESO is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and seeks to maintain a consistent, resilient, and secure infrastructure by partnering with resources across the Company. The ESO implements numerous cybersecurity processes and capabilities, which include but are not limited to: assessing risk associated with significant infrastructure or operational changes and the introduction of new technologies; administering our third-party service provider risk management program; managing secure software development and change management; managing access management and logical access controls, identifying security vulnerabilities through automated scanning technologies; performing penetration testing and due diligence assessments; and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s data in transit. The ESO includes the activities of the Paychex Cyber Fusion Center, which provides 24x7x365 cybersecurity monitoring and incident response. We maintain incident response plans which outline the escalation, investigation, reporting, and overall response procedures depending on the type and severity of incidents. As part of our security program, we require all employees to take information security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. We provide additional ongoing training to our employees about security best practices and awareness, including internal phishing simulations. We maintain a program designed to assess and manage the cybersecurity-related risk associated with third-party service providers that we rely on as part of providing solutions to our clients. This program incorporates a risk-based approach based on service criticality and type of information. Vendor risk assessments are performed and documented within our vendor management system. As part of the vendor risk assessment, we conduct an information security program evaluation of critical third-party providers before engagement and, based on our assessment of the vendor’s risk, contractually require certain third parties we engage to implement security programs commensurate with their risk profile. As of May 31, 2025 , we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition. We continue to invest in cyber-resilience and cyber-threat response preparedness as we anticipate ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats. Refer to the “Risk Factors” section contained in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information on our cybersecurity-related risks.

This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” contained at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K. Overview We are an industry-leading human capital management (“HCM”) company delivering a full suite of technology and advisory solutions in human resources (“HR”), employee benefits, insurance, and payroll for businesses and their employees across the United States (“U.S.”) and parts of Europe. We offer a full range of integrated HCM solutions covering the employee life cycle for businesses and their employees. Clients may choose from a breadth of solutions that also allow integration with some of the most popular HR, accounting, ERP, and point-of-sale applications on the market today. We support our clients through our proprietary, robust, SurePayroll® SaaS-based solutions, Paychex Flex® and Paycor. Our larger clients generally have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs, though with the environment of increasing regulations, we believe the need for HR outsourcing solutions has been moving down-market. Any of our clients on Paychex Flex or Paycor can opt for the integrated suite of HCM solutions, which enables clients to choose the service and software solutions that will meet the needs of their business. Our portfolio of technology, HR advisory, and employee benefits-related solutions is disaggregated into two categories, (1) Management Solutions and (2) professional employer organization (“PEO”) and Insurance Solutions, as discussed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Our mission is to be the leading provider of HR, employee benefits, insurance, and payroll solutions by being an essential partner to businesses across the U.S. and parts of Europe. Our strategy focuses on providing industry-leading, integrated technology; growing our client base; expanding our share of wallet; driving technology innovation; and pursuing strategic acquisitions. We believe that successfully executing this strategy will lead to strong, long-term financial performance. We maintain industry-leading margins by managing our personnel costs and expenses while continuing to invest in our business, particularly in sales and marketing and leading-edge technology. We believe these investments are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we believe that investing in our solutions, people, and digital capabilities will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth. We closely monitor the evolving challenges and needs of our clients, and proactively aid our clients in navigating macroeconomic challenges, legislative changes, and other complexities they may face. Through our unique blend of innovative technology solutions, backed by our extensive compliance and HR expertise, we help clients more"

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), and adjusted EBITDA are summarized as follows: $ in millions, except per share amounts 2025 2024 Change (1) Operating income $ 2,207.7 $ 2,174.1 2 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition-related costs (2) 162.3 — Cost optimization initiatives (3) — 39.5 Adjusted operating income $ 2,370.0 $ 2,213.6 7 % Adjusted operating margin 42.5 % 41.9 % Net income $ 1,657.3 $ 1,690.4 (2 ) % Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition-related costs (2) 196.3 — Cost optimization initiatives (3) — 39.5 Tax impact of above adjustments (40.6 ) (9.6 ) Excess tax benefit related to employee stock-based compensation payments (4) (10.1 ) (11.2 ) Adjusted net income $ 1,802.9 $ 1,709.1 5 % Diluted earnings per share (5) $ 4.58 $ 4.67 (2 ) % Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition-related costs (2) 0.54 — Cost optimization initiatives (3) — 0.11 Tax impact of above adjustments (0.11 ) (0.03 ) Excess tax benefit related to employee stock-based compensation payments (4) (0.03 ) (0.03 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.98 $ 4.72 6 % Net income $ 1,657.3 $ 1,690.4 (2 ) % Non-GAAP adjustments: Interest expense/(income), net 32.6 (45.4 ) Income taxes 518.6 527.6 Depreciation and amortization expense 209.5 176.5 EBITDA $ 2,418.0 $ 2,349.1 3 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition-related costs (2) 121.6 — Cost optimization initiatives (3) — 39.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,539.6 $ 2,388.6 6 % (1) Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Acquisition-related costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses include $40.7 million in amortization of intangibles acquired in the acquisition of Paycor, $70.8 million in compensation costs related to the acquisition and integration of Paycor, including replacement awards, severance, and retention and transaction bonuses, and $50.8 million in other acquisition-related costs, primarily reflecting professional service fees. Acquisition-related costs included in interest expense includes $34.0 million reflecting the amortization of financing fees related to debt instruments associated with the financing of the Paycor acquisition and the excluded component of the initial fair value of the interest rate swaption contracts (\"Swaption Contracts\"). 26 Table of Contents (3) Cost optimization initiatives recognized in fiscal 2024 include further reductions to our geographic footprint, reprioritization of certain technology investments, and headcount optimization. (4) Net tax windfall related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes. This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management. (5) The calculation of the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently. The table may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding. In addition to reporting operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of the performance of our core business operations period over period. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position as of May 31, 2025 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.7 billion. Short-term borrowings of $18.6 million and long-term borrowings of $5.0 billion were outstanding as of May 31, 2025. Our unused capacity under our unsecured credit facilities was $2.0 billion as of May 31, 2025. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations, which was $1.9 billion for fiscal 2025. Our positive cash flows have allowed us to support our business, and pay dividends. We currently anticipate that corporate cash, corporate restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2025, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our business operations, capital purchases, primarily investments in our technology solutions, share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions and debt service for the foreseeable future. For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow on our unsecured credit facilities or use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding needs related to client fund obligations. Historically, we have borrowed, typically on an overnight basis, to settle short-term client fund obligations, rather than liquidate previously collected client funds invested in our long-term AFS portfolio. We believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2025 were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in our assessment. We do not intend to sell these investments until recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not more-than-likely that we would be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Financing Short-term financing: We maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations. The purpose of these credit facilities is to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. We typically borrow on an overnight or short-term basis on our credit facilities. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our credit facilities. Details of our credit facilities are as follows: Maximum May 31, 2025 Amount Outstanding Available $ in millions Expiration Date Available Amount Amount Credit facilities: JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPM”) April 12, 2029 $ 1,000.0 $ — $ 1,000.0 JPM September 17, 2026 $ 750.0 — 750.0 PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”) February 6, 2026 $ 250.0 18.6 231.4 Total Lines of Credit Outstanding and Available $ 18.6 $ 1,981.4 27 Table of Contents Amounts outstanding under the PNC credit facility as of May 31, 2025 remain outstanding as of the date of this report. Details of borrowings under each credit facility during fiscal 2025 were as follows: Year ended May 31, 2025 Credit Facility $1 Billion $750 Million $250 Million $ in millions JPM JPM PNC Number of days borrowed 3 — 365 Maximum amount borrowed $ 201.5 $ — $ 243.9 Weighted-average amount borrowed $ 104.3 $ — $ 20.1 Weighted-average interest rate 8.22 % — % 5.12 % We primarily use short-term borrowings to settle client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds invested in our long-term AFS investment portfolio. Subsequent to May 31, 2025, there were no additional overnight borrowings under our PNC and JPM credit facilities. We expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities to meet our ongoing financial needs. However, if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in, but not limited to, Item 1A in this Form 10-K and other SEC filings, we may need to adjust our capital, operating, and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us. Furthermore, if we determine the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued and obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us. Letters of credit: As of May 31, 2025, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $165.0 million, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between June 1, 2025 and February 27, 2027. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024, or as of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024. Subsequent to May 31, 2025, eight letters of credit expired and were renewed for one year terms. Long-term financing: We have borrowed $4.2 billion through the issuance of three fixed rate corporate bonds (\"Corporate Bonds\") and $0.8 billion through the issuance of long-term private placement debt (“Senior Notes”). Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our long-term financing.

Bridge Loan Commitment: On January 7, 2025, we and our subsidiary, Paychex of New York, LLC, entered into a bridge loan commitment with JPM, pursuant to which JPM committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured credit facility not to exceed $3.5 billion for the acquisition of Paycor, including related fees and expenses. We incurred $14.9 million in debt financing fees, including structuring and commitment fees, which were capitalized as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized as interest expense on a straight-line basis through the issuance date of our Corporate Bonds. The bridge loan commitment expired upon the issuance our Corporate Bonds. Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our long-term financing. Interest Rate Swaption Contracts: On January 31, 2025, we executed three Swaption Contracts with JPM. The Swaption Contracts qualified as cash flow hedges, had an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, and were utilized to manage exposure to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates associated with the issuance of Corporate Bonds to fund our acquisition of Paycor. At inception, we recorded Swaption Contract assets related to paid premiums of $19.2 million. The fair value of the Swaption Contract assets were classified as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon issuance of our Corporate Bonds, the Swaption Contracts expired unexercised. Other commitments: The Company has various long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2025, which include: • operating leases for $84.1 million; • purchase obligations for $384.1 million; • workers’ compensation estimated obligations for $236.8 million; and • long-term Corporate Bonds and Senior Notes for $5.0 billion, plus interest payments of $1.7 billion. 28 Table of Contents Refer to Notes A, I, N, and Q of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these commitments. The liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was approximately $108.6 million as of May 31, 2025. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability. We are a limited partner in five limited partnership arrangements to contribute a maximum of $37.0 million to venture capital funds. As of May 31, 2025, we have contributed $29.0 million of the total funding commitment. The timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined. Our investments in these venture capital funds are not considered part of our ongoing operations, are accounted for under the equity method, and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of May 31, 2025. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such commitment. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and non-officer fiduciaries of our pooled employer plan retirement offering, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee health, medical, and workers' compensation benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2025. We also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retention through our captive insurance company. Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flow Activities Primary sources of cash, restricted cash, and equivalents are through collections for services rendered to our customers and interest earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Primary uses of cash include employee compensation and contractual obligations related to business operations, cash dividends paid, share repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, servicing our long term debt, and acquisitions. Our investment portfolio incorporates both corporate cash and funds held for clients. Interest rates, market conditions, and our variable cash flows are among several factors influencing our investment strategy directing the mix between long-term and VRDN AFS securities vs. short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents held in the portfolio. A portfolio strategy that favors larger balances held in restricted cash and cash equivalents may impact our investing activities due to the offsetting activity in the purchases and sales/maturities of AFS investments. Our cash flows include certain activities that are short-term in nature and have an impact on short-term cash flows due to timing of collection and settlement of obligations as follows: • PEO receivables and worksite-employee (\"WSE\") accrued compensation: PEO receivables and WSE accrued compensation fluctuate based on either/both: (1) the timing of the payroll cut-off date and the Company’s month-end close, and (2) the timing of when cash is collected from the customer, and it is remitted to either the WSE for wages earned or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll taxes. PEO accounts receivable collections and compensation payments to WSEs and applicable tax or regulatory agencies are settled through our corporate cash and the fluctuations impact our operating activities. •"

Fiscal 2024 • Net income attributable to the reasons discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of this Item 7; • Net changes in PEO assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of cash collected and the settlement of payroll taxes; • Net realized losses on the disposal of assets primarily due to our cost optimization initiatives; and • Increase in income tax reserves related to unrecognized tax positions taken for years still subject to audit by regulatory bodies; offset by • Decrease in accrued corporate compensation primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation tied to performance measures and the timing of payroll payments at month-end. Investing Cash Flow Activities Fiscal 2025 • Cash used primarily for the acquisition of Paycor. We financed the acquisition of Paycor by issuing fixed-rate corporate bonds Refer to Note D and Note N of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on these transactions; • Net purchases of short-term accounts receivable due to an increase in our client base, and funding to existing client base, and the timing of net cash collections; and • Cash used to develop and enhance our client-facing internal-use software and the acquisition of third-party customer lists. Fiscal 2024 • Cash used for the acquisition of Alterna Capital Solutions, LLC and settlement of its outstanding debt at closing. Refer to Note D of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on this transaction; • Cash used to develop and enhance our client-facing internal-use software and the acquisition of third-party customer lists; • Net purchases of short-term accounts receivable due to an increase in our client base, and funding to existing client base, and the timing of net cash collections; and • Net sales from AFS securities primarily due to a shift from investing in VRDNs to reinvesting in cash and cash equivalents due to more favorable interest rates. We had no VRDN holdings at May 31, 2024 compared to $344.1 million at May 31, 2023. 30 Table of Contents Financing Cash Flow Activities Fiscal 2025 • Proceeds received from the issuance of Corporate Bonds. The proceeds received were used to acquire Paycor; • Cumulative dividends paid at $4.02 per share for fiscal 2025. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board; and • Repurchases of 0.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $125.50. These shares were retired immediately upon purchase. Fiscal 2024 • Cumulative dividends paid at $3.65 per share for fiscal 2024. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board; • Decrease in client fund obligations related to the timing of collections and remittances of semi-weekly tax payments that were deferred at the end of fiscal 2023 as a result of the Memorial Day holiday; and • Repurchases of 1.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $115.37.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue recognition: Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services as well as investment income earned on funds held for clients. Fees associated with services are recognized when control of the contracted services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. Fees earned for the purchase of client's accounts receivable under non-recourse arrangements are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 50 days for clients in the temporary staffing agency market and approximately 5 to 15 days for other clients. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. We receive advance payments for set-up fees from our clients. Advance payments received for certain of our service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists. PEO Solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans. Direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue. 31 Table of Contents Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts: We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. We determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 340-40”). We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. We determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations. The assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. We regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during fiscal 2025 or 2024. PEO insurance reserves: As part of our PEO solution, we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the"

These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates. With respect to our PEO health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where we retain risk. A reserve for insurance arrangements where we retain risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. The claims liability includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and accepted actuarial methods and assumptions, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. Adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2025 or 2024. Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2025 or 2024. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance. 32 Table of Contents We also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2025 or 2024 as a result of the qualitative analyses performed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
