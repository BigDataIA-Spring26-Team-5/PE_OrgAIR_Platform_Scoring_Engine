          "January 11, 2023Dear Fellow Shareholders,On behalf of the Board of Directors and the senior management team, we are pleased to invite you to join Deere & Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be held virtually on Wednesday, February 22, 2023 at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time (CST). You may join at virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DE2023. At this meeting, you will have a chance to vote on the matters set forth in the accompanying Proxy Statement. We will also report on our business and provide an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions.For nearly 200 years, John Deere has conducted business essential to life. Our purpose is simple: We run so life can leap forward. That means empowering our customers to have economically and environmentally sustainable businesses. Our performance is driven by our Smart Industrial operating model. It gives us valuable insights into the challenges our customers face and opportunities to use technology to further create value. For example, our new fully autonomous 8R Tractor navigates fall tillage all on its own, allowing farmers to concentrate on more important work. In addition, See & Spray™ Ultimate uses computer vision and machine learning to reduce herbicide use by up to two-thirds. And our advanced SmartGrade™ technology is designed to move every ounce of dirt on a construction site with precision and efficiency.Our performance is also being guided by our Leap Ambitions – focused, measurable goals introduced in 2022 – aligned across our customers’ operations. These ambitions are designed to boost economic value, productivity, and sustainability for our customers and John Deere.We also understand that to continue to innovate for our customers, we first must invest in ourselves. We recently hired the company’s first Chief People Officer to ensure John Deere continues to evolve with the changing needs of today’s workforce. And we continue striving to foster an environment that is inclusive and welcoming for everyone. We take pride in our employees, including inside our factories, where ideas and innovation meet up with skilled craftsmanship and quality. We believe this serves as a key differentiator over our competitors and contributes to our customers’ success.This is an exciting time in the history of our company and your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to virtually attend the Annual Meeting, please vote online, by phone, or via standard mail as soon as possible to ensure your vote is recorded promptly. Instructions are in the Proxy Statement, on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, and on the proxy card to explain how to vote your shares.On behalf of the Board of Directors, thank you for your ongoing support of Deere & Company.Sincerely,",

          "WE RUN SO LIFE CAN LEAP FORWARDThis is the one planet we call home. One place to put down roots and lay foundations. One place to raise crops, kids, and hopes. One planet with one caveat: we must all work in harmony with it.At Deere, we’ve always believed in conducting business conducive to life. Paving or planting, we shape the spaces that sustain us. We turn raw materials into machines that advance a chain of livelihoods – from supplier to dealer, from our customers to their consumers, from ourselves to our communities. We innovate on behalf of productivity, profitability, and planet – not with solutions in search of a problem, but with revolutions that we believe elevate all lives in the one world we know.With the dignity that makes us Deere, we run with nature, run our factories with care, and run to support the people who trust us and the planet that sustains us. Working together to design and delight, test and train, outperform and overcome so life can leap forward."

The peer group is developed by starting with the S&P 500 Industrials and then removing companies that are not manufacturing and/or related to the agricultural or construction cycles. Industries removed include Air Freight & Logistics, Airlines, Commercial Services & Supplies, Professional Services, and Trading Companies & Distributors. Within the relevant industries, qualitative discretion was applied to determine suitability and maintain consistency. Companies with significant U.S. government revenue are excluded since stock price and revenue are significantly driven by government actions. The performance peer group for the performance period ending in fiscal 2022 included the 39 companies listed below.",

To determine the incremental cost, we calculate the variable costs for fuel on a per-mile basis, plus any direct trip expenses such as on-board catering, landing/ramp fees, and crew expenses. Fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as pilot salaries, depreciation of aircraft, and maintenance costs, are excluded. Mr. May’s personal usage of company aircraft in fiscal 2022 amounted to approximately 50 hours of travel, which represents less than 1% of the total hours flown by company aircraft."
