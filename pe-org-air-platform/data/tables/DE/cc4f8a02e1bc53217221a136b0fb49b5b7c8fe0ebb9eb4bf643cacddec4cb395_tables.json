These statistical models utilize independent variables, or predictive features, to estimate lifetime default rates, which are subsequently adjusted for expected recoveries to arrive at lifetime credit loss estimates. Independent variables included in the models vary by product, but can include credit quality at time of application, remaining account balance, delinquency status, and various economic factors, such as commodity prices, employment levels, and housing data. The economic factors include forward-looking conditions over our reasonable and supportable forecast period. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we transitioned from the use of transition matrix models to linear regression models to estimate expected credit losses. This change in methodology did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements."

If you die during the six-month delay, such shares shall be distributed in accordance with your will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, payments made with respect to this grant of RSUs may only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted by Section 409A of the Code, and all payments to be made upon a termination of employment hereunder may only be made upon a “separation from service” as defined under Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of these Terms would cause a conflict with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of the RSUs to fail to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each payment hereunder shall be treated as a separate payment, and the right to a series of installment payments under these Terms shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. In no event shall you, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment."

Deere & Company and its United States subsidiaries and affiliates that have adopted the Salaried Pension Plan (jointly the \"Company\") are also deemed to have adopted the Former Plan. The Company amended and restated the Former Plan, and divided it into two separate plans, effective 1 November 1992. This John Deere Senior Supplementary Pension Benefit Plan (the \"Plan\") is one of the two plans which replaced the Former Plan. Effective as of 1 January 2007, the Plan is amended pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, as set forth in Appendices A and B, which form part of the Plan. Amendments to the Plan adopted in 2006 and 2007 are intended to align Plan provisions with prior operational changes and avoid the imposition or any Participant of taxes and interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code."

Section 401(a)(17) of the Code limits the amount of compensation paid to a participant in a qualified defined benefit pension plan which may be taken into account in determining benefits under such a plan. Section 415 of the Code limits the benefit which may be paid under a qualified defined benefit pension plan. This Plan is intended to provide benefits which, when combined with the benefit actually payable under the Salaried Pension Plan, are reasonably comparable to the benefits which participants in the Salaried Pension Plan would have received under such plan if there were no limitations imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code. This Plan is intended to qualify as an unfunded deferred compensation plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\")."
