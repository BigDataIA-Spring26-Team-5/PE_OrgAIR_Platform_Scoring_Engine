          "January 10, 2024Dear Fellow Shareholders,On behalf of the Board of Directors and the senior management team, we are pleased to invite you to join Deere & Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be held virtually on Wednesday, February 28, 2024 at 10 a.m. Central Standard Time (CST). You may join at virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DE2024. At this meeting, you will have a chance to vote on the matters set forth in the accompanying Proxy Statement. We will also report on our business and provide an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions.Since 1837, John Deere has conducted business essential to life. Our purpose is simple: We run so life can leap forward. That means empowering our customers to have economically and environmentally sustainable businesses so that they can provide the food, fuel, clothing, shelter, and infrastructure the world needs. Our performance is driven by our Smart Industrial Operating Model. It gives us valuable insights into the challenges our customers face and opportunities to use technology to further create value. An example of this is ExactShot™, our groundbreaking planting technology designed to dramatically reduce the amount of starter fertilizer needed during planting. In addition, we made our advanced camera detection and artificial intelligence systems from our revolutionary See & Spray™ platform available as a precision upgrade for previous-generation sprayers, helping to reduce herbicide use, lower costs, and decrease impact on crops and the land. And our new P-Tier line of excavators is built for increased productivity, efficiency, and reduced CO2e emissions. Our efforts are also being guided by our Leap Ambitions—focused, measurable goals designed to deliver exceptional customer experiences, robust financial outcomes, and sustainable practices while creating lasting value for our customers and John Deere.Most of all, we take pride in our employees. They serve as a key differentiator for John Deere and contributor to our customers’ success. And we continue to foster an environment that is inclusive and welcoming for everyone. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for our company and your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to virtually attend the Annual Meeting, please vote online, by phone, or via standard mail as soon as possible to ensure your vote is recorded promptly. Instructions are in the Proxy Statement, on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, and on the proxy card to explain how to vote your shares.On behalf of the Board of Directors, thank you for your ongoing support of Deere & Company.Sincerely,",

          "WE RUN SO LIFE CAN LEAP FORWARDThis is the one planet we call home. One place to put down roots and lay foundations. One place to raise crops, kids, and hopes. One planet with one caveat: we must all work in harmony with it.At Deere, we’ve always believed in conducting business conducive to life. Paving or planting, we shape the spaces that sustain us. We turn raw materials into machines that advance a chain of livelihoods—from supplier to dealer, from our customers to their consumers, from ourselves to our communities. We innovate on behalf of productivity, profitability, and planet—not with solutions in search of a problem, but with revolutions that we believe elevate all lives in the one world we know.With the dignity that makes us Deere, we run with nature, run our factories with care, and run to support the people who trust us and the planet that sustains us. Working together to design and delight, test and train, outperform and overcome so life can leap forward."

For fiscal 2021 and 2022, represents the aggregate grant date fair value of PSUs and RSUs computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The values in this column exclude the effect of estimated forfeitures of PSUs and RSUs. Assumptions made in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 22, “Share-Based Compensation,” of our consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”). For PSUs, the value at the grant date is based upon a target payout of the performance metric over the three-year performance period. If the highest level of payout were achieved, the value of the PSU awards as of the grant date would be as follows: $12,699,757 (May); $2,317,623 (Jepsen); $2,418,758 (Campbell); $2,519,894 (Reed); and $1,534,883 (Rose). For RSUs, the value at grant date is the market value of the RSUs using the closing price of a share of Deere common stock as reported on the NYSE on the grant date, multiplied by the number of shares underlying each award. RSUs vest over three years with 34% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date, 33% vesting on the second anniversary of the grant date, and 33% vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date, at which time they may be settled in Deere common stock. As disclosed in Note 22, “Share-Based Compensation” of our 2023 Form 10-K, the Company changed the accounting treatment of the LTIC awards for fiscal 2023 and now accounts for such awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. As a result, in accordance with SEC rules, LTIC awards granted in fiscal 2023 are included in this column and are no longer included in the non-equity incentive plan compensation column. For fiscal 2023 LTIC awards, the value at grant date is based upon a target payout of the performance metric over the three-year performance period and assumptions regarding base pay. The aggregate grant date fair values of such LTIC awards are as follows: $2,001,898 (May); $858,143 (Jepsen), $902,818 (Campbell); $886,768 (Reed); and $807,664 (Rose). If the highest level of payout were achieved, the value of the LTIC awards as of the grant date would be as follows: $4,320,022 (May); $1,865,325 (Jepsen); $1,962,435 (Campbell); $1,927,548 (Reed); and $1,755,600 (Rose). Refer to the Fiscal 2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and footnote (7) thereto for a detailed description of the grant date fair value of stock awards and LTIC awards."
