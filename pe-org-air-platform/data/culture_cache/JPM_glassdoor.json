They do not hire anyone that deserves it and don't fire anyone that deserves it. At my previous role we had enforced overtime that if you missed it you could be fired for. They paid everyone the same whether you had a degree or not. There is zero flexibility for anything. And they boast about how they give so much PTO but wont let you work remotely or have the day off if there is an extreme weather event. Multiple times told us we were expected to drive into work during tornado/hail storms when I had the capability to work remotely.

    "pros": "I worked as a Scrum Master within the SMB Payments group at the Tampa Fountain Square location. While the company itself has strong brand recognition and benefits, my specific experience was marked by significant challenges—primarily due to the team environment and management style. See Cons",
    "cons": "The department I supported had high turnover, which I later learned stemmed from a pattern of micromanagement and a lack of psychological safety within the team. As someone with over a decade of experience in Agile and team coaching, I found it difficult to apply industry best practices or foster true team empowerment under a leadership approach that was controlling, dismissive of collaboration, and unreceptive to coaching principles.\n\nDespite efforts to build trust and enable team autonomy, decisions were often made unilaterally, and feedback was not welcomed. New ideas, especially those aligned with Agile values, were discouraged. This made it nearly impossible to create a healthy team dynamic or sustain meaningful improvement.  If you are an experienced Scrum Master or Agile Coach looking to make an impact, I strongly advise asking thoughtful questions during the interview about leadership style, team culture, and turnover history. This particular department may not be conducive to growth, especially if you value psychological safety, autonomy in your decisions, collaboration, and trust-based leadership.",
    "advice_to_management": "Investigate the SMB Payments area in Tampa; in particular, the group that the scrum masters (agility leads) report to, her manager, and the leadership above. Your employees are beat down emotionally and verbally, burnt out, micromanaged, and mistreated. The manager has severe behavioral issues that need to be addressed asap as this is damaging to employees, and costly to the company - high turnover is costly.  Employees are also severely overworked",

They made my conversion impossible, in which not only did I suffer greatly, but the Firm did too. Advice to HR: Pay attention. Open lines of communication. Take the time to review the documentation submitted (even if it seems excessive), as requested, and try again. I can only imagine how much talent falls through the cracks due to a lack of communication, organization, and a willingness to gain a deeper understanding of someone's history.

Lots of training that can be accessed at anytime to educate yourself on financial health. Great college programs and benefits. Typical 9-5 job with short Saturday work shifts. Challenging task to complete but can be rewarding to help out customers. Great teller job compared to other banks where you can learn more banker roles and use in your resume. Good career for taking online classes after work. Pay is decent but the part time hours hurts pay checks. Full time hours makes difference when available.",
    "cons": "Need to work on sales to climb up ladder even without incentive pay. Easier to apply from the outside with banking experience to get the role you want than to work your way up. This is the culture throughout all SoCal. You’re pretty much a glorified teller as an AB. You do a lot of work as an AB depending on location but it definitely helps to your resume if your looking to apply into a different financial institution. Other than that you must constantly bug your manager and increase your numbers every week to stand out even though you don’t get the incentives a licensed banker earns. Essentially need to be a history of constantly earning numbers to show your worth it to the higher ups. Other than that get used to seeing outside new hires getting the role you want without them fully knowing the system that you already know. Managers are protected even if employees file HR claims. Employees are way more disposable but depending on relationships to managers  you can also be protected but don’t expect it.  Gossiping is huge within this industry as most office environments so be careful on what you share and how you act.",

The general sentiment of that thread reflects all I'd say here in greater detail, but...\n\n- Lack of opportunity to be compensated at a competitive rate to your peers (think ~30% lower on average). For context, when I left for a new job I got about a 50% bump in comp based on skill and experience.\n- Lack of opportunity to advance. On multiple occasions people I knew were turned down from promotions because \"there are too many people at that level\". Nepotism is rampant and extremely deep rooted.\n- Toxic culture. Just look at the reddit thread. You aren't an employee, you aren't even a number to them. You are simply a collection of metrics an an attendance count.\n- Betting on the wrong things. I get that the commercial real estate market benefits from full RTO, but the fact of the matter is that the company and working environment tends to falter when you take away the one thing that was keeping most of your decent talent in house.\n- Overall entrapment: you will spend your time learning internal tools that not only cannot translate to helping you work elsewhere, they will actively contribute to you falling behind your peers in industry. It's an clever but detrimental way to retain personnel if you ask me.\n\nLearn how to actually promote based on merit, and push back against terrible decisions. The people at the top are just people too, and in many cases they aren't as well informed about a given situation as you are, and therefore incapable of making the optimal choice given the circumstances. An org of this size should be able to run itself, but competent people are simply cowed by the arbitrary decisions of other people with fancy titles next to their names.",
