I was the only colored worker in there for only 1 week before I was let go. I have a total of 6 year’s semiconducting experience and everyone working in the lab that I spoke with confirmed with me that they had zero experience prior to starting there. Their reason for letting me go after one week of work was that I didn’t have enough experience. Wouldn’t the specific experience needed come with 1 year of training that they promised? I wasn’t given a fair chance to prove my work ethic and abilities. How would you feel if this happened to you, knowing that you were the only colored person working there and was let go with this excuse after only 1 week of working knowing that you’re capable of doing a job that you know is very easy for you? On top of that, the government pays them with tax payers dollars to work for 8 full hours and out of the 8 full hours, they only work for about 4-6 hours, but they make sure to document in eTim that they worked for a total of 8 hours.",

If you do not fit in well with the team you are placed on, you are going to have a rough 90 day probation period. Many of the young, early 20-something’s (who can is a majority of the workforce) act like this is a fraternity and with no checks and balances in place, they get away with sitting back and playing on their phone most of the day and hardly do any of the work that needs to be accomplished.

While others in the industry are going with the 9/80 schedule, GE has just gone with a 10/90.
