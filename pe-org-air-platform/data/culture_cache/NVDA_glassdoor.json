Being a part of this organization since the launch of DGX in 2016 has been very fulfilling and incredibility rewarding.",

Plan on working nights &amp; weekends regularly (all the time when you don’t have childcare). There’s no onsite gym or any daycare options…definitely missing the benefits of a big tech company. Quarterly “free days” are almost never free—just frustrating if you’ve planned something fun, that you can no longer do.  \n\nVery volatile and hard to predict when your weekend will blow up…which leads to constant anxiety.",

Some of these people walked away from 1 M+ stock packages due to extreme management harassment which includes inappropriate adult material displayed at work, physical threats from management, and extreme disfunction overall. I saw one manager have nearly an entire team quit. That manager was then promoted. They put managers in between this individual and his direct reports when he threatened to hurt one of his reportees. This should result in immediate termination. This was the worst treatment I have ever seen. Managers will deliberately strip you of equipment to force you to fail.",

NVIDIA has a big campus in Santa Clara, and that was likewise shut down. The company that provided the on-site food for employees was obviously not needed, but the CEO, Jensen Huang, decide to keep paying them so that they wouldn't have to lay off their people. The money was already budgeted, so rather that treat it as a windfall for NVIDIA, he made sure that the people from the catering service could still make their mortgage payments and support their families.

    "pros": "- You get to work on the most advanced computing platforms ever created, so advanced that they're beginning to think like humans. Let that sink in\n\n- Heavy focus on R&amp;D. Make computing solutions that no one else could possibly create and slap a product name on it. That's NVIDIA\n\nExample: \"Why don't we make the GPUs programmable for non-graphics tasks!? Let's see what happens agghhhhhhHHHH!!!\" * AI Boom commences *\n\n- Final Boss Technical Experts. I've been on so many meetings/calls where you don't know someone, but what they're saying is absolutely next level and you have nothing but respect for them. No ego, no berating, just straight up knowledge experts. It drives you to want to be that good\n\n- I can literally reach out to anyone in the company. I have to, I'm a program manager. I don't deal with \"How dare you talk to so and so without consulting so and so\" No red tape, just do. Just make sure when you reach out you do your homework first since a lot of technical experts are obviously very busy\n\n-  On the welfare of your employees front... doing the exact opposite of whatever the hell the rest of the Valley is doing currently \n\nI know crushing your employees, laying them off, labeling them as low-performers and occasionally offering them as sacrifice to the Gods is the hip, trendy thing to do as of late, but it never works long-term\n\nPast Valley greats did the exact same thing at their peak and it ended terribly for them. Some of them were competitors to NVIDIA, now they're not, oh well\n\nFoolish... but welcome",
    "cons": "- You did it, you did the impossible that has never been done before! Okay... time to do the impossible again... and again... and again..... and again... (repeats exponentially)\n\nJust be prepared for that and you'll do fine. It can get rough at times, but it will make you stronger, I promise. It's a marathon\n\n- Not on NVIDIA itself, but just the societal reality of working here now\n\n*** WARNING - RANT ***\n\nFor years, nobody cared about us since the world was focused on companies like SnapChug, Tweeter, FaceBong, YoloMcSwapChad or whatever. We suddenly got big and the societal attention it brings SUCKS \n\nUse Linkedin? Get ready for every Financial Advisor, Realtor, Tech Journalist or extremely desperate job seeker will hit you up NON-STOP. Just ignore\n\nSomeone asks \"What do you for a living?!?\" Personally, I deflect and tell them I work for a paper distribution company located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. If NVIDIA gets brought up, good luck and get ready for the same dumb conversation you always have when it gets brought up\n\nIs it a first world problem? Sure, but after reading about the horror stories that face big ticket lottery winners, it's kind of similar in a way\n\nI like working with really fast computers, that's it. The moment I'm not working just leave me alone and let me live my life hahaha",
    "advice_to_management": "Don't Change. The drama is in the products themselves, not at each other. Never change that\n\nI like that I get to work with final boss engineers and we have each other's backs. That's how NVIDIA has always won and will continue to win for years to come\n\n*** For those interested in NVIDIA ***\n\nIt's a good place to work, but we're seeing thousands of applicants minimum per job now. Just have those expectations when you apply",
