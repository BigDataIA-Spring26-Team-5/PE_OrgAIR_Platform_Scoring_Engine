Being a part of this organization since the launch of DGX in 2016 has been very fulfilling and incredibility rewarding.",
    "cons": "Sales overall at NVIDIA are often treated as second class citizens instead of professional assets - this is especially the case, unfortunately, in our Healthcare organization.  Too often we are tasked with to do's while not being any part of the discussions on what to do or why.",

Plan on working nights &amp; weekends regularly (all the time when you don’t have childcare). There’s no onsite gym or any daycare options…definitely missing the benefits of a big tech company. Quarterly “free days” are almost never free—just frustrating if you’ve planned something fun, that you can no longer do.  \n\nVery volatile and hard to predict when your weekend will blow up…which leads to constant anxiety.",

If I have any concerns about my progress or need adjustments, I can always discuss with my mentor. Both my manager and mentor consistently check on my progress and are responsive to any help I need.\n\nThere are also a lot of leisure and entertainment activities, along with numerous lectures and extra learning opportunities.

Some of these people walked away from 1 M+ stock packages due to extreme management harassment which includes inappropriate adult material displayed at work, physical threats from management, and extreme disfunction overall. I saw one manager have nearly an entire team quit. That manager was then promoted. They put managers in between this individual and his direct reports when he threatened to hurt one of his reportees. This should result in immediate termination. This was the worst treatment I have ever seen. Managers will deliberately strip you of equipment to force you to fail.",

NVIDIA has a big campus in Santa Clara, and that was likewise shut down. The company that provided the on-site food for employees was obviously not needed, but the CEO, Jensen Huang, decide to keep paying them so that they wouldn't have to lay off their people. The money was already budgeted, so rather that treat it as a windfall for NVIDIA, he made sure that the people from the catering service could still make their mortgage payments and support their families.
