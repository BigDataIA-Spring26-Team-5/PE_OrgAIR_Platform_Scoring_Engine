    "item_1": "Item 1.\nBusiness\nUnless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Paychex,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Paychex, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are an industry-leading human capital management (“HCM”) company delivering a full suite of technology and advisory services in human resources (“HR”), employee benefit solutions, insurance, and payroll processing. As of May 31, 2024, we served greater than 745,000 small- to medium-sized businesses and their employees across the U.S. and parts of Europe. Paychex was incorporated in Delaware in 1979, maintains a corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and has a fiscal year that ends on May 31st.\nFor any organization, a key function is effective HCM, which requires both resources and expertise. Organizations are faced with continuous evolution in employer-employee relations including: an increasing number and complexity of federal, state, and local regulations; changing workforce dynamics; and challenges attracting and retaining talent. The workplace is rapidly changing as employees increasingly become mobile, work remotely, and expect a user experience similar to consumer-oriented applications. We specialize in helping small- to medium-sized businesses who do not have the resources or expertise to adapt to the constantly evolving environment.\nPaychex offers a full range of integrated HCM solutions from hire to retire for businesses and their employees that allows us to customize our offering to the client's business, whether it is small or large, simple or complex. We believe that we have the breadth of solutions to cover the spectrum of the employee life cycle, but we also allow integrations with popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications.\nThe key features of our solutions are:\n•\nComprehensive cloud-based platform optimized to meet the HR and payroll needs of small- and medium-sized organizations;\n•\nExpertise in HR and payroll with our technology backed by approximately 250 compliance experts and over 650 HR business professionals;\n•\nStreamlined workforce management that combines technology with flexible, tech-enabled support options;\n•\nModern, mobile, and intuitive user experience with self-service capabilities;\n•\nScalable and customizable platform that allows clients the ability to add services as they grow;\n•\nSoftware as a service, or “SaaS”, delivery model that reduces total cost of ownership for our clients; and\n•\nAdvanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities powered by large data sets.\nWe market our solutions through a combination of direct and virtual sales forces and ecommerce solutions supported by various digital lead generation and multi-channel marketing initiatives. Over 50% of our revenues are from solutions other than payroll processing.\nCompany Strategy\nOur strategy is to be the digitally driven HR leader, serving as an essential partner to small-to-medium sized businesses by providing them with the technology and advisory services they need for HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance. We believe that successfully executing this strategy will lead to strong, long-term financial performance. We intend to strengthen and extend our position as a leading provider through continued investments in both our innovative technology and HR advisory solutions. Key elements of our strategy include:\n•\nGrowing our client base and market share.\nWe operate in a large and growing market, with significant potential to expand within our current target markets. We continually invest in new demand generation, sales tools, go-to-market strategies along with channel partnerships, eCommerce, and digital marketing.\n•\nExpand our share of wallet.\nWe offer a full-suite of integrated solutions incorporating a unique combination of industry-leading HR technology and HR advisory solutions that sets us apart in the industry. We intend to continue to increase penetration across our HCM software, HR outsourcing, retirement, insurance, and payments offerings.\n•\nLeveraging technology innovations\n.\nWe continue to invest significantly in our proprietary, award-winning Paychex Flex\n®\nplatform and mobility applications to maximize efficiency and functionality for our clients and their employees. We believe we are well positioned to capture the AI opportunity with large and growing data sets,\n3\nTable of Contents\npredictive analytics and AI models, and increased AI investments to improve efficiency, enhance the customer experience, and unlock new growth opportunities.\n•\nEngaging in strategic acquisitions\n.\nWe utilize acquisitions, when appropriate, as a means to expand our portfolio, enter new markets, or increase our scale. We will continue to evaluate and monitor potential acquisitions and target acquisitions that are aligned with our overall strategy.\nOur Solutions\nOur solutions bring together payroll and HCM software with HR and compliance expertise, along with flexible, personalized, and technology-enabled support capabilities. Clients have the option of doing payroll online using our SaaS technology, outsourcing to our payroll specialists, or using a combination of these methods. Payroll is integrated with HCM software modules for clients who have more complex HR needs. We also provide comprehensive HR outsourcing through our administrative services organization (“ASO”) and PEO solutions. The integration of leading-edge technology and flexible support options allows us to meet our clients’ needs how, when, and where they want.\nWe closely monitor the evolving challenges and needs of small- and medium-sized businesses, and proactively aid our clients in navigating macroeconomic challenges, legislative changes, and other complexities they may face. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”), top challenges for employers were macroeconomic pressures including inflation and interest rates, maintaining sufficient staffing levels, providing appropriate employee development, keeping technology current, and ensuring legal and regulatory compliance.\nWe provide a unique blend of innovative technology solutions, backed by our extensive compliance and HR expertise, that help customers more effectively hire, develop, and retain top talent in this challenging workforce environment. As businesses operate in a tight labor market, having an online portal for employee self-service that is intuitive and easy-to-use helps increase employee retention and efficiency for our customers. We continue to invest in our technology, enhancing our solutions to continuously improve the customer and employee experiences from hiring and onboarding through employee retention.\nHCM Technology:\nPaychex Flex is our proprietary HCM SaaS platform that provides seamless workforce management throughout the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement through an integrated suite of solutions including recruiting, onboarding, HR, time and attendance and employee benefits. It utilizes a single cloud-based platform, with single client and employee records. Clients can select the modules they need and easily customize solutions as they grow. In addition, Paychex Flex presents function-focused analytics throughout the platform, providing HR leaders with data to make more informed business decisions. Paychex Flex uses a device-independent design throughout the HCM suite, which allows full functionality of all application components, regardless of device or screen size. We believe our Paychex mobile solutions add greater value and convenience for our clients and their employees by allowing them instant access on their mobile device, and usage of our mobile and self-service capabilities continue to grow.\nHR and Compliance Expertise:\nPaychex augments its HCM software solutions with 50+ years of experience. We have over 650 HR business professionals who are dedicated to our clients and have the experience and training to provide HR best practices and advice. Our HR business partners are available to provide our ASO and PEO clients with specific guidance on HR issues. In addition, we have approximately 250 compliance professionals who are in real-time contact with tax agencies and regulators to understand upcoming or newly enacted laws and regulations and advocate for our clients’ interests. The contributions of these compliance experts are intended to ensure that our HCM solutions are updated in a timely fashion to adhere to applicable regulations and to help our clients stay in compliance.\nTechnology-Enabled Client Service:\nPaychex Flex also provides technology-enabled service with options that include self-service, a 24/7 dedicated service center, an individual payroll specialist, and integrated service via a multi-product service center. In addition, medium-sized clients can utilize a relationship manager for more personalized service. This flexible platform services our small- to medium-sized clients and a portion of our PEO business.\nWithin Paychex Flex, we leverage embedded AI to assist our clients. Our Paychex Flex Intelligence Engine allows individual preference on learning style - via written how-to-documents, tutorial-style video vignettes, or guided interactive tours. The Paychex Flex Intelligence Engine also includes the Flex Assistant, a customer service chatbot that can answer questions across thousands of topics and provides access to over 1,200 instructional resources. At any time, a live Paychex agent is just a click away, with the entire chat conversation available in real-time to provide a more personalized service experience. The Flex Assistant consistently handles nearly two-thirds of questions that would otherwise reach a payroll/HR functionary or a customer service representative, with high satisfaction scores.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe platform embeds self-service capabilities that empower client employees to manage their HR and benefits information from any location, on any device. These self-service capabilities allow for greater access and convenience for client employees and greater productivity for clients.\nOur Clients\nPaychex has HR solutions to fit the needs of any small- to medium-sized business, from do-it-yourself payroll to comprehensive HR outsourcing. The target market for our integrated HCM solutions is small- to medium-sized businesses. Within this space, we serve a diverse client base operating in a broad range of industries throughout the U.S. and parts of Europe. The flexibility and scalability of our solutions allow our clients to select the best solution that meets their needs. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that generally do not contain specified contract periods and may be terminated by either party with 30-days notice of termination. We believe client retention is a useful indicator of client satisfaction with our solutions and support. For fiscal 2024, client retention was in the range of 82% to 83% of our beginning client base.\nWe support our small-business clients, reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our solutions and customer support options for a quick and easy payday. Clients may choose to have our service team handle everything for them, or process payroll themselves utilizing our proprietary, robust SaaS Paychex Flex platform and our SurePayroll\n®\nSaaS-based solutions. Both solutions allow users to process payroll when they want, how they want, and on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone).\nWhile Paychex Flex is our primary SaaS-based platform utilized by the majority of our clients for their HCM needs, there are some clients that use other platforms, including SurePayroll clients, and certain PEO clients.\nBoth our small- and medium-sized clients can choose one of our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, which include ASO and PEO solutions, and participate in our benefits offerings, which include our insurance and retirement services. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. Our retirement services solutions offer many plan design options to meet the client’s requirements, as well as various investment options.\nDescription of Solutions\nWithin our HCM solutions, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM technology and HR advisory solutions that allow our clients to meet their diverse HR and payroll needs. Clients can select solutions on an á la carte basis or as part of various solution bundles. Our offerings often leverage the information gathered in our base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum.\nOur portfolio of solutions is comprised of the following:\nManagement Solutions:\n•\nPayroll processing solutions:\nOur payroll processing solutions include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.\n•\nPayroll tax administration solutions:\nPayroll tax administration solutions provide for accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable federal, state, and local tax or regulatory agencies. In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending up to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes.\n•\nEmployee payment solutions:\nOur employee payment solutions provide an employer the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex\n®\n), or a check drawn on the employer’s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Our\n5\nTable of Contents\nReadychex solution provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.\nWe also allow employers to opt for more flexible pay options. Same day ACH functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit, allowing employers the flexibility to pay employees via direct deposit on the same day they initiate payroll. In addition, we are giving business owners the ability to leverage real-time payments to process payroll and deliver net pay to their employees immediately for time worked. Pay-on-demand functionality enables an employee to request access to a portion of earned pay before the scheduled pay date, which is deposited into a traditional bank account or a third-party account.\n•\nHR solutions:\nOur HR solutions allow businesses to outsource and simplify their HR administration and compliance support. These bundled services incorporate integrated HCM technology solutions and HR advisory services through both virtual and on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative. Clients can opt for different levels of HR outsourcing from our low-touch HR solutions to our full-service HR Pro package. We also offer HR support to non-payroll clients through our HR Partner Plus solution.\n•\nRetirement solutions administration:\nOur retirement solutions line offers a variety of options to employers, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE plans, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, owner-only 401(k) plans, Pooled Employer Plans, profit sharing plans, and money purchase plans. These solutions provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients may choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services include relationships with financial advisors.\n•\nHR administration solutions:\nWe offer cloud-based HR administration software solutions for employee benefits management and administration, time and attendance reporting, recruiting, and onboarding. These services include:\n•\nPaychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee personnel information, performance management, HR compliance, and reporting. Our Learning Management solution complements our performance management tool. When combined with our workflow and approval engine, we offer businesses the flexibility to capture ongoing performance feedback, recommend and enroll employees in specific training courses, and leverage automated workflows to track progress and approve compensation changes tied to performance.\n•\nDigital communication solutions, including Paychex Flex HR Connect and HR Conversations, which helps strengthen connections and keep workers engaged no matter their work location. Paychex Flex HR Connect provides the ability to digitally submit questions, requests, and incident reports directly to HR through an easy-to-use workflow. HR Conversations enables managers and HR leaders to initiate communications with employees, and enhancements to performance assessments allow for 360-degree feedback digitally within the tool.\n•\nBenefits administration software solution that manages the employee-benefit enrollment process for both open-enrollment and life events.\n•\nTime and attendance solutions, including our integrated Paychex Flex Time software, provide timekeeping, scheduling, and workforce analytics. The InVision\nTM\nIRIS Time Clock, a biometric clock that scans the iris, provides fast and accurate time capture. Paychex Flex Time also works with wearable technology to allow for employees to clock in and out using their smartwatch.\n•\nApplicant tracking suite provides technology solutions that streamline, simplify, and drive the applicant workflow and onboarding process for companies of all sizes.\n•\nRegulatory compliance solutions:\nWe offer new-hire reporting solutions, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids federal and state governments in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing solution provides deductions from employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These solutions enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties. We also offer comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet.\n6\nTable of Contents\n•\nOther HR solutions and support:\nWe offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance solutions, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents.\n•\nBusiness services:\nWe offer various business solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Paychex Advance, LLC, provides a portfolio of solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding (via the purchase of accounts receivable) and outsourcing services, which include payroll processing, invoicing, and tax preparation. Alterna Capital Solutions, LLC (“Alterna”), which was acquired in July 2023, offers funding to small businesses through the purchase of outstanding accounts receivable balances under non-recourse agreements. In addition, through partnerships with third-party providers, we provide clients opportunities for solutions such as payment processing services, financial programs, and a small-business loan resource center.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions:\n•\nPEO solutions:\nOur licensed PEO subsidiaries offer businesses a combined package that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and both virtual and on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. What differentiates our PEO solutions from our ASO solutions is that we serve as a co-employer of our clients’ employees and assume the risks and rewards of certain workers’ compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. We are certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act to provide PEO solutions. We offer the PEO Protection Plus Package, which helps business owners protect their bottom line from unforeseen costs, including cyberattacks and employee lawsuits.\n•\nInsurance solutions:\nOur licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing employers to expand their employee benefit and corporate offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers’ compensation, business-owner policies, cybersecurity protection, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance solutions simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients have the option to integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market and sell our solutions and support primarily through our direct sales force based in the markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of solutions. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. Our virtual sales force manages inbound sales leads, sales in areas without a direct sales force presence, and sales of various ancillary solutions.\nIn addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client referrals. More than 50% of our new small-market payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. We also utilize digital marketing as a means to market our services.\nWe have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions\nTM\nProgram. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2025. We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations.\nOur website is available at www.paychex.com. It is a cost-efficient channel that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct and virtual sales forces. The website allows us to market to existing and prospective clients that want to learn more about our solutions and support, and offers information about our core lines of business: human resources (www.paychex.com/human-resources), payroll (www.paychex.com/payroll), benefits (www.paychex.com/employee-benefits), and insurance (www.paychex.com/business-insurance).\n7\nTable of Contents\nPaychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance primarily to businesses and the CPA community. We provide free webinars, podcasts, white papers, and other information on our website to inform businesses on the impact of regulatory change as well as HR and business best practices. Paychex WORX, available at www.paychex.com/worx, is a digital destination for insightful resources useful for businesses at every stage, from entrepreneur to enterprise. Paychex WORX highlights our expertise and ability to help businesses of all sizes with a wide range of HR and financial information for current clients and prospects alike.\nWe also track current regulatory issues that impact the business community and provide regulatory updates. We issue small business trend reports through our Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch. Our Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals. Through Paychex Flex, AccountantHQ offers access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts, along with an extensive accountant resource library. AccountantHQ drives efficiency by putting accountants in the best position possible to easily access critical client payroll and HR data, as well as powerful reporting tools.\nMarkets and Competition\nWe remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Census data indicates that in the U.S., there are over 6 million employer firms in our target markets.\nThe market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online service providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. We believe our solutions also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs.\nCompetition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. Our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, combined with personalized support provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled solution capabilities, differentiates us from our competitors.\nSoftware Maintenance and Development\nThe ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is critical to our future success and growth. We strive to foster a workplace that encompasses diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”); attract, retain, and develop talented employees; and keep them safe. In fiscal 2023, we were a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the single largest business-led initiative to advance DE&I in the workplace. We also created a new DE&I leadership position to ensure that our efforts in building and sustaining a diverse culture of inclusion are realized.\nFor detailed information regarding our human capital activities, we encourage investors to visit our Corporate Responsibility website page at https://www.paychex.com/corporate/corporate-responsibility. We have also made our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) report available on our website. The information contained on our website and in our ESG report is not and should not be viewed as being incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nOur Employees:\nAs of May 31, 2024, we employed approximately 16,500 people, primarily in the U.S. and on a full-time basis. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\n8\nTable of Contents\nPaychex Culture\n: Our core cultural values (“Paychex Values”) are designed to guide decision making aligned to the expectations of clients, stockholders, regulators, employees, and the multiple communities in which we operate and to reflect our continuing commitment to DE&I. The Paychex Values are:\nIntegrity\nAccountability\nInnovation\nPartnership\nRespect\nService\nEach of these values guide our decision-making process and are critical to our ongoing success. All employees are required to verify their understanding and observance of these values during our annual “Right Way” training, review these values with management during periodic performance discussions, and are further encouraged to attend ongoing training during the year. Volunteer “Culture Champions” throughout the Company also help promote these values daily. We encourage employee feedback through our employee engagement surveys, as described below. This approach empowers our employees and allows us to make a positive impact in the communities we work and serve. As a result of our commitment to these principles, in 2024 we were recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. We have achieved this recognition 16 times, and consecutively since 2012. In addition, we were also recognized by Forbes as a Best Employer for Diversity for 2024.\nTalent Acquisition and Development:\nWe compete for talent along with our direct competitors and other companies in the geographic areas we serve. We invest significant resources to attract and retain top talent. Our Talent Acquisition Team, in conjunction with certain third-party partners, have developed comprehensive processes to identify and recruit accomplished professionals.\nOnce hired, our world-class Training Department provides functional training for payroll and HCM specialists and sales associates and also offers personal training, professional development, and leadership-development programs. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized as one of the top training organizations in the world with a 2024 Training APEX Award presented by Training magazine. Paychex ranked number four on the list, the fourth consecutive year in the top ten. This is also the Company's 23\nrd\nconsecutive appearance on the list that identifies organizations that excel at training and employee development.\nComprehensive Compensation and Benefits:\nWe are committed to providing a fair wage and a total rewards package that allows our employees to be their best in every area of their lives.\nWe regularly review employee salaries to ensure we are competitive in the industry and offer financial benefits such as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, tuition assistance, scholarships for children of employees, and financial education. We are also committed to rewarding employees with comprehensive and competitive benefits and well-being package which includes medical, prescription, dental, and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, employee assistance program, paid family leave, and a variety of well-being programs. For fiscal 2024, compensation-related expenses accounted for approximately 58% of our total expenses.\nEmployee Well-being Initiatives:\nIn addition to providing a comprehensive compensation and benefits package, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Healthier employees are at lower risk of injury from workplace related exposures, perform work more safely with lower rates of absenteeism, experience better job performance, and can live their lives more fully outside of work. Our well-being program is a robust program focusing on the physical, emotional, community, career, and financial health of our employees.\nOur award-winning well-being initiatives offer a wide variety of services, tools, and resources that can help employees achieve their health goals using a holistic approach. In addition, we sponsor onsite health screenings, Red Cross blood donation events, flu vaccination clinics, vaping and tobacco cessation, weight management, resiliency training, meditation and yoga classes, and a variety of other programs. Similar to our Culture Champions, we also promote the use of “Well-Being Champions” - Paychex employees who serve as a liaison between the Employee Well-Being Program and their team members. Our employees’ financial well-being is equally important, so we have developed programs for financial education and support. We maintain procedures for events such as fires, severe weather, medical emergencies, and active shooters, as well as other important information related to general workforce safety.\nIn recognizing the ever-growing diversity of our workplace, we annually celebrate Paychex Culture Day. This is an additional paid day off for employees to celebrate and recognize a holiday that is significant to them. This is just one of the many ways we celebrate our unique heritages, and it reflects our Company's commitment to DE&I and flexibility.\n9\nTable of Contents\nEmployee Engagement\n: We regularly ask our employees to share their views on working at Paychex through company-wide engagement surveys. Facilitated internally by our Human Resources Organizational Development Team, the survey methodology is periodically updated to reflect currents trends and issues including company direction and strategy, DE&I, individual development, collaboration, and our Paychex Values. A third-party administers the survey in order to maintain confidentiality of responses. We use the survey responses to help inform management and assist in developing programs and policies that will maintain and promote Paychex Values.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.\nSeasonality\nThere is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new worksite employees associated with our ASO and PEO businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.\nAvailable Information\nWe are subject to the informational and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that includes our reports, proxy statements, and other information.\nOur corporate website, www.paychex.com, provides materials for investors and information about our services.

Risk Factors\nOur future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. The following risk factors represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business. These are not the only risks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect, possibly to a material extent, our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. In addition, refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our solutions and support.\nThe market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changing industry standards. To maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to: enhance our current solutions and introduce new solutions in order to keep pace with solutions offered by our competitors, including the successful utilization of AI and machine learning solutions; enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements; and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards.

If our systems become outdated, it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality, time to market, cost and innovation relative to our competitors. The failure to provide a more efficient and user-friendly customer-facing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations. The failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools, natural language processing, and AI/machine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities.\nWe may experience software defects, undetected errors, and development delays, which could damage our relationship with clients, decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability.\nOur solutions rely on software and computing systems that can encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, bias, viruses, or defects. Defects in our solutions and errors or delays caused by our solutions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential clients, harm to our reputation and exposure to liability. In addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, bias, viruses, or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities or Internet disruptions.\nWe rely upon information technology (“IT”) networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store\nelectronic information, and to support a variety of business processes, some of which are provided by third-party vendors. Cyberattacks and security threats are a\nrisk to our business and reputation. A cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption or outage, corruption of data, or theft\nof personal or other sensitive information, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients, result in liability or regulatory\nsanction, or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business. The increasing velocity of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities, and Internet disruptions enabled by new and\nemerging technologies, such as advancements in AI and machine learning, may outpace our organization's ability to compete and/or manage the risk appropriately. In addition, threat actors may seek to engage in payment-related fraud or by more frequently attempting to gain access to our systems\nthrough phishing or other means. Furthermore, security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of threat actors and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\n11\nTable of Contents\nData Security and Privacy Leaks\n: We collect, use, and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients, employees of our clients, and our employees, including: bank account, credit card, and social security numbers, tax return information, health care information, retirement account information, payroll information, system and network passwords, and other sensitive personal and business information. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile cyber and ransomware attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. We may be particularly targeted for cyberattack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect, use, and retain. Vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Furthermore, if any of our solutions contain a software vulnerability, the vulnerability may be exploited to obtain access to our data or our clients’ data.\nOur service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host. The security of our IT infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information. We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. While we have security systems and IT infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information, including our Cyber Fusion Center, if our security measures are breached, either internally or externally, our business could be substantially harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. Any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage, and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Third-parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\nData Loss and Business Interruption:\nIf our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, including Internet or systems failure, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, both the Company and our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Hardware, applications, and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. Any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. The speed to closure of significant cybersecurity incidents may be influenced by the cooperation of governmental or law enforcement agencies. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of clients’ business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack or act of war, public health emergency, pandemic, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Climate-related weather disasters, including hurricanes, flooding, snowstorms, and severe rainstorms, could also threaten the business continuity of our operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, snowstorms, and rainstorms and has been successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients. If that were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions.\nAs part of providing services to clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. Service providers include, but are not limited to, banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees, information technology vendors servicing cloud-based platforms, and couriers used to deliver client payroll checks. Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business.\nMany federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “co-employment” relationship within our PEO business. State and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and change with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations. There is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. Although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws. Incurring additional liabilities related to our PEO business may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends.\nWithin our PEO business, we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees. We establish workers’ compensation insurance reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. The insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our PEO costs. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity, or our reserves were insufficient for claims activity, our costs could increase. In addition, in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms, if at all. Also, as a co-employer in the PEO, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities associated with health care reform, which may result in increased costs. Increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients.\nWe made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nAcquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities, and difficulties in integrating operations. Successful integration involves many challenges, including the difficulty of developing and marketing new solutions and support, our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the loss of key employees of an acquired business. The integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process. In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill, interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition, and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders. If the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nFinancial Risks\nOur clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf, resulting in financial loss to us.\nAs part of our payroll processing service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities. It is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them. We have in the past, and may in the future, make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed, resulting in loss to us. Similarly, our ability to operate our Purchased Receivable reporting unit is dependent on the ability of our clients' clients to remit their accounts receivable to us. If a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf or we are not able to collect purchased receivable balances, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance.\nWe receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees.\nA change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could\nadversely impact our interest income.\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the “Agreement”) that we entered into in January 2019\nin connection with our acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P., contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. These covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries (taken as a whole), certain merger\ntransactions, certain sales of assets and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The Agreement, and the credit agreements providing for our credit facilities, also contain financial covenants, which are reviewed for\ncompliance on a quarterly basis, that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5:1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.0:1.0. In\naddition, certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20% of our consolidated stockholders’ equity. If we do not comply with these covenants, it could result in\nmaterial adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.\nLegal, Regulatory and Political Risks\nOur business, services, and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies.\nMany of our services, particularly payroll tax administration services, employee benefit plan administration services, and PEO services are designed according to government regulations that often change. Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. The addition of complex added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business.\nOur business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations.\nOur services are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the SECURE Act 2.0, data privacy regulations, and anti-money laundering rules. The growth of our international operations also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations. The enactment of new laws and regulations, modifications of existing laws and regulations, or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business. Additionally, as federal, state, and international regulations become more complex, the risk that we may be unable to comply with those regulations increases, particularly in the event there are different or additional regulatory standards in different jurisdictions. Failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the areas of payment networks, health care reform and retirement plans as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base. Failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, which require us to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, and maintain transaction records, could result in civil and criminal penalties and adversely impact our business reputation.\nWe are required to comply with regulations administered by multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide including, but not limited to, the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). OFAC places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons. A violation of a sanction or embargo program, or of the FCPA, or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations.\nOur reputation, results of operations, or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy and AI laws and regulations.\nOur solutions require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as geolocation and biometric data. Certain solutions are enhanced with the use of AI and machine learning. Our solutions are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels, including those governing personal privacy, AI and machine learning, as well as ethical considerations. In the U.S., we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade\n14\nTable of Contents\nCommission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the ACA, federal and state labor and employment laws, and state data breach notification and data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended. Our European operations are subject to the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We could be subject to litigation or reputational risk if we or our third-party providers fail to utilize data practices sufficient to safeguard proprietary, confidential, and personal or identifying information. The regulatory framework for privacy, AI, and machine learning issues are rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be\nunable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of the use of AI tools, a cyberattack, or other wrongful conduct by employees\nor third-parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with\nknowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage. Competitors\nmay also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and solutions. Any significant impairment or\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights of AI algorithms and content generated by AI and we could become subject to similar claims of infringement as we expand our use of AI. To the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights\nwith litigation, we could incur significant expenses and/or be required to pay substantial damages. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or\nvendors in connection with claims or litigation. The litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming.\nWe are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and, as such, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees, or other costs.\nWe are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees, or other third-parties for various actions. From time to\ntime, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct, and employment and labor law matters. The\ndamages sought against us in some of these legal proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one\nor more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by macroeconomic and/or political factors of the U.S. and global economy and such impact could be materially adverse.\nWe and our clients are subject to the impacts related to inflationary pressure, changes in interest rates, potential instability of the banking environment, climate change-based obligations, and other macroeconomic and/or political events. Banking volatility may subject us and our clients to losses on uninsured funds and may make equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain, and additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Additionally, our business is substantially dependent on our clients’ continued use of our solutions and support, and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them. Our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions. If they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection, we may not be paid for services we already provided, and our client base will shrink, which will lower our revenue. If under financial pressure, our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the solutions and support we provide, which would reduce our revenue. Our clients may decrease their workforce, which would decrease their demand for our services. Because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry, we may face pricing pressure on our services and challenges in onboarding new clients, which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations. Furthermore, if the third-party service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients, our operations could be materially disrupted, and we could face significant penalties or liabilities.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment.\nTrade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability. Additionally, instability in the banking environment may adversely affect our business. These conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business. Further, inflation may negatively impact our business, raise costs and reduce profitability. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In addition, new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit.\nWe invest our funds held for clients in high quality, investment-grade marketable available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, money markets, and other cash equivalents. We also invest our corporate funds in short- to intermediate-term instruments. Funds held for clients and corporate investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility and inflationary pressure. The interest we earn on funds held for clients and corporate investments may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest or lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds. If we are unable to reinvest our AFS securities when they mature, our interest income earned and investment portfolio would be reduced. If we sell AFS securities to satisfy short-term funding requirements, we may recognize losses, which would further reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments.\nConstriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings. Historically, we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. However, should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. Growth in customizable funding solutions offered to our clients by the purchasing of their accounts receivable through non-recourse arrangements, including funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry, may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited. In addition, our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited. See also “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” If all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified people, which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction.\nOur success, growth, and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified and diverse personnel at all levels, including management, technical, compliance, and sales personnel. Competition for these individuals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain our key people, or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly-qualified individuals in the future, which could harm our future success.\nIn the event we receive negative publicity, our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed, and clients may not use our solutions and support, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are committed to good corporate citizenship, which is reflected in our company culture and core values. Disclosure of our corporate governance practices including our ESG initiatives, may draw negative publicity from stakeholders.\nNegative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us, our policies, our corporate employees, or others associated with us, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. If we are unable to maintain quality HCM and employee benefit-related solutions and PEO and insurance solutions, our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish. In addition, if\nour brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and\nrecruiting talent and retaining employees.\nItem 1B.\nUnr\nesolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n16\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C.\nCybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and information. Our security program is intended to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats, and is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Version 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”). The NIST CSF provides a flexible model for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. Our security infrastructure uses a layered controls approach, incorporating various capabilities guided by the NIST CSF and other industry standards and best practices. We routinely invest in our security processes and capabilities, including those related to our risk management and assessment programs, vulnerability and intrusion detection, incident response plans, and other advanced detection, prevention, and protection capabilities.\nWe conduct regular assessments of cybersecurity risks to identify threats to us and potential vulnerabilities that could negatively affect our business operations if exploited. We track cybersecurity risks within our enterprise risk management system with cybersecurity threats considered to be among the top-priority risks to us. In addition, our Enterprise Security Organization (the “ESO”) conducts technical risk assessments, and, in some instances, we engage with third-party experts to assist with or perform technical risk assessments. The results of these risk assessments are reported to management. Our processes require escalation of significant cybersecurity risks to management and Paychex’s Audit Committee derived from the Board of Directors (the “Board”).\nThe ESO is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and seeks to maintain a consistent, resilient, and secure infrastructure by partnering with resources across the Company. The ESO implements numerous cybersecurity processes and capabilities, which include but are not limited to: assessing risk associated with significant infrastructure or operational changes and the introduction of new technologies; administering our third-party service provider risk management program; managing secure software development and change management; managing access management and logical access controls, identifying security vulnerabilities through automated scanning technologies; performing penetration testing and due diligence assessments; and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s data in transit. The ESO includes the activities of the Paychex Cyber Fusion Center, which provides 24x7x365 cybersecurity monitoring and incident response. We maintain incident response plans which outline the escalation, investigation, reporting, and overall response procedures depending on the type and severity of incidents.\nAs part of our security program, we require all employees to take information security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. We provide additional ongoing training to our employees about security best practices and awareness, including internal phishing simulations.\nWe maintain a program designed to assess and manage the cybersecurity-related risk associated with third-party service providers that we rely on as part of providing services to our clients. This program incorporates a risk-based approach based on service criticality and type of information. Vendor risk assessments are performed and documented within our vendor management system. As part of the vendor risk assessment, we conduct an information security program evaluation of critical third-party providers before engagement and, based on our assessment of the vendor’s risk, contractually require certain third parties we engage to implement security programs commensurate with their risk profile.\nAs of May 31, 2024, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition. We continue to invest in cyber-resilience and cyber-threat response preparedness as we anticipate ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats. Refer to the “Risk Factors” section contained in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information on our cybersecurity-related risks.\nGovernance\nCybersecurity risks are overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board. Annually, the Audit Committee reviews an assessment of our risk management processes with the Board. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing significant cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor, control, and report such exposures. The Audit Committee receives quarterly updates from our CISO regarding our cybersecurity risk management program. These updates include a status of current capabilities, ongoing initiatives, and the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.\nOur management is responsible for implementing our security program, which is overseen by our Security Governance Council (the “SGC”) that regularly reports to our CEO and Audit Committee. The SGC is chaired by our CISO and is comprised of senior leaders and key personnel throughout the Company to support cross-functional representation. The members of the SGC are comprised of our executives and managers who understand our business operations, including but not limited to individuals\n17\nTable of Contents\nfrom the following departments: Operations, Information Technology, Finance, Internal Audit, Legal, Human Resources and Organizational Development, and Risk Management. The SGC meets on a quarterly basis with the mission to develop, coordinate, and sustain the organization’s enterprise security program; coordinate and respond to security risks and incidents; and develop, implement, and maintain the organization’s enterprise security strategy in alignment with, or in support of, business goals and objectives. The recommendations of the SGC are considered when updating the information security policies, procedures, and standards at Paychex.\nOur CISO has over two decades of experience in various roles involving information security: developing and implementing cybersecurity programs to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data. Our CISO has earned relevant degrees and holds several information security certifications, including the Certified Chief Information Security Officer certification. Prior to joining Paychex in September 2019, he served as VP and CISO at a publicly traded company in the HCM industry. Before that, he held security leadership positions at several banks, insurance companies, and professional services firms.\nOur CISO reports to our Senior Vice President of Information Technology and Product Development (“SVP of IT and PD”). Our SVP of IT and PD has over 45 years of experience in the field of information technology and has earned a relevant degree. Prior to joining Paychex in November 2008, he held senior leadership positions at several technology, financial services, and HCM companies.\nIt\nem 2.\nProperties\nWe owned and leased the following properties as of May 31, 2024:\nSquare feet\nOwned facilities:\nRochester, New York\n832,000\nOther U.S. locations\n30,000\nTotal owned facilities\n862,000\nLeased facilities:\nRochester, New York\n53,000\nOther U.S. locations\n895,000\nInternational locations\n179,000\nTotal leased facilities\n1,127,000\nOur facilities in Rochester, New York house various distribution, processing, and technology functions, certain ancillary functions, a telemarketing unit, and other back-office functions.

Dividends have historically been paid on our common stock in August, November, February, and May. The level and continuation of future dividends are dependent on our future earnings and cash flows and are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”).\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 8,229 holders of record of our common stock, which includes registered holders and participants in the Paychex, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. There were also 3,110 participants in the Paychex, Inc. Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 3,745 participants in the Paychex, Inc.

A detailed review of our fiscal 2023 performance compared to our fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 performance and our financial condition as of May 31, 2023 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) for fiscal 2023. This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” contained at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an industry-leading human capital management (“HCM”) company delivering a full suite of technology and advisory services in human resources (“HR”), employee benefits, insurance, and payroll for small- to medium-sized businesses and their employees across the United States (“U.S.”) and parts of Europe.\nWe offer a full range of integrated HCM solutions covering the employee life cycle for businesses and their employees. Clients may choose from a breadth of solutions that also allow integration with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today.\nWe support our small-business clients by utilizing our proprietary, robust, software as a service (“SaaS”) Paychex Flex® platform and the Company’s SurePayroll® SaaS-based solutions. Our medium-sized clients generally have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs, though with the environment of increasing regulations, we believe the need for HR outsourcing services has been moving down-market. Any of our clients on Paychex Flex can opt for the integrated suite of HCM solutions, which allows clients to choose the service and software solutions that will meet the needs of their business.\nOur portfolio of technology, HR advisory, and employee benefits-related solutions is disaggregated into two categories, (1) Management Solutions and (2) professional employer organization (“PEO”) and Insurance Solutions, as discussed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nOur mission is to be the leading provider of HR, employee benefits, insurance, and payroll solutions by being an essential partner to small- and medium-sized businesses across the U.S. and parts of Europe. Our strategy focuses on providing industry-leading, integrated technology; delivering superior customer experiences; expanding our leadership in HR; growing our client bases; and engaging in strategic acquisitions. We believe that successfully executing this strategy will lead to strong, long-term financial performance.\nWe maintain industry-leading margins by managing our personnel costs and expenses while continuing to invest in our business, particularly in sales and marketing and leading-edge technology. We believe these investments are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we believe that investing in our solutions, people, and digital capabilities will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth.\nWe closely monitor the evolving challenges and needs of small- and medium-sized businesses, and proactively aid our clients in navigating these challenges. Through our unique blend of innovative technology solutions, backed by our extensive compliance and HR expertise, we help clients more effectively hire, develop, and retain top talent in this challenging workforce environment. Our ongoing investments in our platforms have prepared us well for the demands of the current business and regulatory environments, allowing us to adapt while maintaining strong solutions and support delivery, resulting in high levels of client satisfaction and retention.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFiscal 2024 Business Highlights\nHighlights compared to fiscal 2023 are as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(3)\nTotal revenue\n$\n5,278.3\n$\n5,007.1\n5\n%\nOperating income\n$\n2,174.1\n$\n2,033.1\n7\n%\nNet income\n$\n1,690.4\n$\n1,557.3\n9\n%\nAdjusted net income\n(1)\n$\n1,709.1\n$\n1,548.4\n10\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n4.67\n$\n4.30\n9\n%\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n(1)\n$\n4.72\n$\n4.27\n11\n%\nDividends paid to stockholders\n(2)\n$\n1,315.3\n$\n1,175.0\n12\n%\n(1)\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measures. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in all periods include an adjustment for net tax windfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. In fiscal 2024, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share also include adjustments for one-time cost optimization initiatives. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7 for a discussion of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share.\n(2)\nDividends paid to stockholders represented approximately 78% of net income for fiscal 2024 compared to approximately 75% of net income for fiscal 2023.\n(3)\nPercentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.\nFor further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, and our financial position as of May 31, 2024, refer to the tables and analysis in the “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7.\nBusiness Outlook\nOur payroll and PEO client base was greater than 745,000 clients as of May 31, 2024 and approximately 740,000 clients as of May 31, 2023. Client retention remained high in the range of 82% to 83% of our beginning client base for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and we have sustained high revenue retention.\nWe continue to increase penetration of our integrated solutions beyond payroll processing, including our HR outsourcing and employee benefit solutions. These offerings are included as part of the integrated HCM solutions within Paychex Flex or provided through the PEO platform.

We implemented enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform designed to improve the client and client employee experiences from hiring and onboarding through employee retention. We also continue to focus on artificial intelligence (“AI”) and related technology to leverage innovative technology and advanced analytics to gain deeper insights into prospects and clients regarding their behavior, preferences, and evolving needs. In fiscal 2024, we successfully implemented several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients.\nWe have further strengthened our position in the industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, businesses of all sizes, and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website (www.paychex.com) to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. The Paychex Insurance\n23\nTable of Contents\nAgency, Inc. website, www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance, helps small-business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (the \"fourth quarter\"), we focused on cost optimization initiatives, including further reductions to our geographic footprint, reprioritization of certain technology investments, and headcount optimization. These initiatives are directed at generating additional cost savings for us and providing greater value to our customers.\nResults of Operations\nSummary of Results of Operations for Fiscal Years:\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(1)\nRevenue:\nManagement Solutions\n$\n3,866.4\n$\n3,730.5\n4\n%\nPEO and Insurance Solutions\n1,265.6\n1,176.8\n8\n%\nTotal service revenue\n5,132.0\n4,907.3\n5\n%\nInterest on funds held for clients\n146.3\n99.8\n47\n%\nTotal revenue\n5,278.3\n5,007.1\n5\n%\nTotal expenses\n3,104.2\n2,974.0\n4\n%\nOperating income\n2,174.1\n2,033.1\n7\n%\nOther income, net\n43.9\n15.1\nn/m\nIncome before income taxes\n2,218.0\n2,048.2\n8\n%\nIncome taxes\n527.6\n490.9\n8\n%\nEffective income tax rate\n23.8\n%\n24.0\n%\nNet income\n$\n1,690.4\n$\n1,557.3\n9\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n4.67\n$\n4.30\n9\n%\n(1)\nPercentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.\nn/m – not meaningful\nThe changes in revenue as compared to the prior year were primarily driven by the following factors:\n•\nManagement Solutions revenue:\n$3.9 billion for fiscal 2024, reflecting an increase of 4%:\no\nIncrease in the number of clients and clients' employees for HCM solutions and worksite employees for HR solutions;\no\nHigher revenue per client resulting from pricing realization and product attachment, including increased demand for HR solutions and retirement solutions; and\no\nLower revenue from ancillary services, primarily due to the expiration of our Employee Retention Tax Credit Service.\n•\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue:\n$1.3 billion for fiscal 2024, reflecting an increase of 8%:\no\nGrowth in the number of average PEO worksite employees and increases in average wages per worksite employee;\no\nHigher health insurance premiums; and\no\nGrowth in ancillary services.\n•\nInterest on funds held for clients:\n$146.3 million for fiscal 2024, reflecting an increase of 47%:\no\nHigher average interest rates;\no\nHigher average investment balances; and\no\nLower realized losses on investment sales.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk.

The table may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding.\nIn addition to reporting operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP\n27\nTable of Contents\nmeasure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial position as of May 31, 2024 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion. Short-term borrowings of $18.7 million and long-term borrowings of $800.0 million were outstanding as of May 31, 2024. Our unused capacity under our unsecured credit facilities was $2.0 billion as of May 31, 2024. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations, which was $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024. Our positive cash flows have allowed us to support our business, pay dividends and fund our acquisition of Alterna Capital Solutions, Inc. We currently anticipate that corporate cash, corporate restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2024, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our business operations, capital purchases, primarily investment in our technology solutions, share repurchases, dividend payments, and the servicing of long-term debt for the foreseeable future.\nFor client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow on our unsecured credit facilities or use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding needs related to client fund obligations. Historically, we have borrowed, typically on an overnight basis, to settle short-term client fund obligations, rather than liquidate previously collected client funds invested in our long-term AFS portfolio. We believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2024 were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in our assessment. We do not intend to sell these investments until recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not more-than-likely that we would be required to sell these investments prior to that time.\nFinancing\nShort-term financing:\nWe maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations. The purpose of these credit facilities is to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. We typically borrow on an overnight or short-term basis on our credit facilities. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our credit facilities.\nDetails of our credit facilities are as follows:\nMaximum\nMay 31, 2024\nAmount\nOutstanding\nAvailable\n$ in millions\nExpiration Date\nAvailable\nAmount\nAmount\nCredit facilities:\nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The 2017 Credit Facility Amendment, among other things, (a) amended the interest rate provisions under the 2017 Credit Facility, and (b) made other ministerial changes to the 2017 Credit Facility.\nSubsequent to May 31, 2024, there were no additional overnight borrowings under our PNC and JPM credit facilities.\nWe expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities to meet our ongoing financial needs. However, if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in, but not limited to, Item 1A in this Form 10-K and other SEC filings, we may need to adjust our capital, operating, and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us. Furthermore, if we determine the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued and obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.\nLetters of credit:\nAs of May 31, 2024, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $168.5 million, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between June 26, 2024 and September 29, 2025. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023, or as of May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023. Subsequent to May 31, 2024, one letter of credit expiring on June 26, 2024, was renewed for a one year term.\nLong-term financing:\nWe have borrowed $800.0 million through the issuance of long-term private placement debt (“Senior Notes”). Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our long-term financing.\nOther commitments:\nThe Company has various long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2024, which include:\n•\noperating leases for $73.2 million;\n•\npurchase obligations for $211.2 million;\n•\nworkers’ compensation estimated obligations for $218.6 million; and\n•\nlong-term Senior Notes debt obligations for $800.0 million, plus interest payments of $117.6 million.\nRefer to Notes A, I, N, and Q of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these areas.\nThe liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was approximately $86.4 million as of May 31, 2024. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability.\nWe are a limited partner in three venture capital fund arrangements and have committed to contribute a maximum amount of $30.0 million for investment in equity and debt securities of start-up entities primarily in the financial technology sector. As of May 31, 2024, we have contributed $23.4 million of the total funding commitment. The timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined. Our investments in these venture capital funds are not considered part of our ongoing operations, are accounted for under the equity method, and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of May 31, 2024.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIn the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such commitment. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and non-officer fiduciaries of our pooled employer plan retirement offering, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us.\nWe currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee health and medical benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2024. We also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retention through our captive insurance company.\nOperating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flow Activities\nPrimary sources of cash, restricted cash, and equivalents are through collections for services rendered to our customers and interest earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Primary uses of cash include employee compensation and contractual obligations related to business operations, cash dividends paid, share repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, and acquisitions.\nOur investment portfolio incorporates both corporate cash and funds held for clients. Interest rates, market conditions, and our volatile cash flows are among several factors influencing our investment strategy directing the mix between long-term and VRDN AFS securities vs. short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents held in the portfolio. A portfolio strategy that favors larger balances held in restricted cash and cash equivalents will impact our investing activities due to the offsetting activity in the purchases and sales/maturities of AFS investments.\nOur cash flows include certain activities that are short-term in nature and have an impact on short-term cash flows due to timing of collection and settlement of obligations as follows:\n•\nPEO receivables and worksite-employee (\"WSE\") accrued compensation:\nPEO receivables and WSE accrued compensation fluctuate based on either/both: (1) the timing of the payroll cut-off date and the Company’s month-end close, and (2) the timing of when cash is collected from the customer, and it is remitted to either the WSE for wages earned or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll taxes. PEO accounts receivable collections and compensation payments to WSEs and applicable tax or regulatory agencies are settled through our corporate cash and the fluctuations impact our operating activities.\n•\nClient fund obligations:\nClient fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of when cash is collected from the clients and when it is remitted to employees of the clients utilizing employee payment services or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. Fluctuations in client fund obligations impact financing activities.\nSummarized cash operating, investing, and financing cash flow information is as follows for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023:\nYear ended May 31,\nIn millions\n2024\n2023(1)\nChange\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,897.7\n$\n1,706.2\n$\n191.5\nNet cash (used in)/provided by investing activities\n(260.9\n)\n211.7\n(472.6\n)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,874.7\n)\n(711.4\n)\n(1,163.3\n)\nNet change in cash, restricted cash, and equivalents\n$\n(237.9\n)\n$\n1,206.5\n$\n(1,444.4\n)\nCash dividends per common share\n$\n3.65\n$\n3.26\n(1)\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 includes a revision to previously reported amounts related to the presentation of cash flows associated with short-term receivables purchased from our clients under non-recourse arrangements, net of funding reserves.

Refer to Note D of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on this transaction;\n•\nCash used to develop and enhance our client-facing internal-use software and the acquisition of third-party customer lists; and\n•\nNet purchases of short-term accounts receivable due to an increase in our client base, and funding to existing client base, and the timing of net cash collections; offset by\n•\nNet sales from AFS securities primarily due to a shift from investing in VRDNs to reinvesting in cash and cash equivalents due to more favorable interest rates. Our VRDN holdings were $- at May 31, 2024 compared to $344.1 million at May 31, 2023.\nFiscal 2023\n•\nNet sales from AFS securities primarily due to a shift from investing in VRDNs to reinvesting in cash and cash equivalents due to more favorable interest rates.

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.\nRevenue recognition:\nRevenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services as well as investment income earned on funds held for clients. Fees associated with services are recognized when control of the contracted services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. Fees earned for the purchase of client's accounts receivable under non-recourse arrangements are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 40 to 60 days for clients in the temporary staffing agency market and approximately 5 to 15 days for other clients. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nWe receive advance payments for set-up fees from our clients. Advance payments received for certain of our service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists.\nPEO Solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans. Direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue.\nInterest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts:\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. We determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 340-40”). We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. We determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations.\nThe assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. We regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 or May 31, 2023.\nPEO insurance reserves:\nAs part of our PEO solution, we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates.\nWith respect to our PEO health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where we retain risk. A reserve for insurance arrangements where we retain risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. The claims liability includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims.\nEstimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and accepted actuarial methods and assumptions, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. Adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2024 or 2023.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets:\nGoodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter. During fiscal 2024 and 2023, a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2024 or 2023. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.\nWe also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2024 or 2023 as a result of the qualitative analyses performed.\n33\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal 2024 or as of May 31, 2024.\nStock-based compensation costs:\nAll stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model. We will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.\nThe fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant. For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period.\nWe estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.\nThe assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award.\nRefer to Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nIncome taxes:\nWe account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nWe maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIte\nm 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk Factors\nChanges in interest rates and interest rate risk:\nFunds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and AFS securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of AFS securities. As a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term AFS securities. We follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. A substantial portion of our portfolios are invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We invest predominately in corporate bonds; municipal bonds; U.S. government agency securities; and VRDNs when available in the market. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the AFS securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years.\nDuring fiscal 2024, our primary short-term investment vehicles were U.S. government agency discount notes and bank demand deposit accounts. We have no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. We have insignificant exposure to European investments. We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.\nDuring fiscal 2024, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment p",
