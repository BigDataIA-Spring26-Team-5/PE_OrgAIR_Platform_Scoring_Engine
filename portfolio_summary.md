## Per-Company Deep Dive

---

### 🟢 NVIDIA (NVDA) — 85.26

**The AI leader. Dominates every dimension.**

NVIDIA is the clear portfolio frontrunner. With 109 AI job postings spanning 45 unique skills (CUDA, PyTorch, TensorRT, vLLM, Ray, Kubernetes, and more), it has the deepest and most distributed AI talent pool of any company scored. The talent concentration of 0.097 is the lowest in the portfolio — AI capability is spread across many teams and seniority levels, not concentrated in a few key individuals.

**What drives the score:**
- **Technology Stack (88.1)** — NVIDIA doesn't just use AI tools, it builds the platforms others use. SageMaker, MLOps, feature stores — detected across job descriptions and SEC filings.
- **Use Case Portfolio (90.8)** — The highest single dimension score in the portfolio. NVIDIA has 5+ AI product lines in production (data center GPUs, inference platforms, autonomous driving, digital twins, AI cloud services) with documented multi-billion-dollar revenue.
- **Leadership Vision (86.2)** — Jensen Huang's proxy statements describe "accelerated computing" strategy with specificity rare in SEC filings. Board includes AI expertise; CTO Michael Kagan leads technology direction.

**Where it's (relatively) weaker:**
- **Culture (70.7)** — Despite a 4.56/5.0 Glassdoor rating (#1 Best-Led Company 2025), employee reviews express satisfaction in non-technical language. Keyword matching undervalues what's genuinely one of the strongest AI cultures in the world.

**H^R amplifier:** Technology sector timing factor (1.20) × strong position factor (+0.734) produces H^R of 93.25 — the highest in the portfolio. NVIDIA isn't just in the right sector, it's the undisputed leader within it.

**Synergy bonus:** 79.86 — the largest. When both V^R (81.17) and H^R (93.25) are high, the multiplicative synergy reward is substantial. This is by design: companies that are strong internally AND well-positioned externally should receive extra credit.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI Jobs Detected | 109 |
| Unique Skills | 45 |
| Senior/Mid/Entry Split | 6 / 77 / 3 |
| Glassdoor Rating | 4.56 / 5.0 |

### 🟢 JPMorgan Chase (JPM) — 66.80

**The financial sector's AI powerhouse. Institutional scale meets measured adoption.**

JPMorgan represents what $15B+ annual technology spend looks like in AI readiness. The V^R of 67.26 reflects solid but not exceptional internal readiness — strong AI Governance (76.6) and Use Cases (77.8) show institutional commitment backed by real deployments in fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk management, and customer analytics.

**What drives the score:**
- **Technology Stack (78.2)** — JPM runs production ML platforms, has dedicated MLOps teams, and actively uses cloud AI services. SEC filings reference specific technology investments with quantified outcomes.
- **Use Case Portfolio (77.8)** — Multiple AI use cases in production across retail banking, investment banking, and asset management. Unlike companies that talk about AI pilots, JPM has measured ROI.
- **AI Governance (76.6)** — Strong governance frameworks reflecting regulatory requirements. Risk committee oversight of technology, documented AI policies, and compliance infrastructure.

**Where it falls behind:**
- **Culture (37.5)** — Large banks have hierarchical cultures that score poorly on change readiness and innovation metrics. Employee reviews emphasize stability and compensation, not experimentation.
- **Talent (59.4)** — JPM has a sizable AI team but with moderate skill concentration (0.267), suggesting less diversity than pure tech companies. 74 AI job postings detected with 11 unique skills.

**Sector context:** Financial Services' moderate timing factor (1.05) and JPM's positive position factor (+0.50) produce H^R of 72.36. JPM leads its sector in AI adoption, but finance faces more regulatory caution than technology, limiting the timing multiplier.

| Metric | Value |

### 🟢 Walmart (WMT) — 60.03

**Retail scale creates AI opportunity. Surprisingly strong internals, but sector context limits the ceiling.**

Walmart's V^R of 67.35 is remarkably close to JPMorgan's (67.26), revealing that the world's largest retailer has invested heavily in AI infrastructure. Supply chain optimization, demand forecasting, inventory management, and store automation drive real AI deployment at unprecedented scale.

**What drives the score:**
- **Technology Stack (81.5)** — Walmart runs modern data platforms (Snowflake, cloud ML services) and has built internal AI tools for supply chain operations. The tech stack rivals financial institutions.
- **Data Infrastructure (79.0)** — Scale is Walmart's advantage. Operating 10,500+ stores generates massive data that feeds ML models. SEC filings describe data-driven decision-making infrastructure.
- **Use Case Portfolio (77.5)** — AI in production for demand forecasting, last-mile delivery optimization, and automated inventory replenishment. Real deployments, not pilot programs.

**Where it falls behind:**
- **Culture (36.4)** — Retail culture is operationally focused. Employee reviews emphasize customer service, scheduling, and store management — not innovation or data literacy.
- **Talent (60.1)** — Walmart's AI team is smaller and more narrowly skilled than tech-sector peers. TC of 0.279 reflects high team_size_factor (0.476) and skill_concentration (0.467).

**The V^R–H^R gap story:** Walmart's V^R (67.35) nearly matches JPMorgan's (67.26), but its Org-AI-R is 6.77 points lower (60.03 vs 66.80). The entire difference comes from sector context: retail faces less AI adoption pressure (timing 1.00 vs 1.05) and Walmart's market position advantage is smaller (+0.30 vs +0.50). This is the H^R formula working exactly as designed — sector expectations calibrate the final score.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI Jobs Detected | 21 |
| Unique Skills | 18 |
| Glassdoor Rating | 3.36 / 5.0 |
| TC Risk | 🟡 Medium (0.279) |

### 🟡 GE Aerospace (GE) — 46.62

**Industrial AI through a different lens. Predictive maintenance and digital twins, not LLMs.**

GE illustrates how manufacturing companies approach AI fundamentally differently from tech or finance. The V^R of 47.98 reflects genuinely moderate AI maturity — GE has foundational data infrastructure and governance, but limited dedicated AI talent and narrow use case deployment.

**What drives the score:**
- **AI Governance (58.7)** — GE's SEC filings discuss risk management frameworks and technology oversight in detail. Industrial companies take governance seriously because operational AI failures have physical safety implications.
- **Data Infrastructure (51.7)** — GE has invested in sensor data platforms for its LEAP engine analytics and industrial IoT infrastructure. The data exists; the AI layer on top is still developing.

**Where it struggles:**
- **Talent (14.2)** — Only 8 AI job postings detected with limited skill diversity. Manufacturing AI is a specialized niche — GE isn't competing for the same talent pool as NVIDIA or JPMorgan.
- **Use Case Portfolio (13.3)** — Despite having predictive maintenance and digital twin programs, the keyword matcher struggled to detect GE's industrial AI language. "LEAP engine analytics" doesn't match "production AI" or "ML pipeline" in the rubric.
- **Technology Stack (35.8)** — GE uses industrial-specific tools (SCADA, PLC systems, simulation software) rather than the cloud ML platforms the rubric rewards.

**The data quality story:** GE's initial Org-AI-R was 39.74 (out of range) because the SEC 10-K parser captured only 500 words of table-of-contents boilerplate instead of the actual 63,650-word filing. GE's HTML filings use `<div>`/`<span>` formatted headers that don't survive BeautifulSoup text extraction. After implementing a proportional fallback parser and re-ingesting 3 filings (producing 185 chunks of real content), GE's scores corrected to their true values. This single bug fix moved GE from out-of-range to validated — demonstrating that pipeline reliability matters as much as algorithmic sophistication.

**TC concentration:** 0.302 (High) — skill_concentration is 1.0, meaning all AI roles require the same narrow skill set. No entry-level AI hiring was detected, suggesting GE hasn't begun building distributed AI capability.

### 🔴 Dollar General (DG) — 38.89

**The AI baseline. What minimal tech investment looks like in the scoring framework.**

Dollar General anchors the bottom of the portfolio by design. As a discount retailer focused relentlessly on low-cost operations, DG has minimal technology investment and near-zero dedicated AI capability. Its Org-AI-R of 38.89 is exactly what the framework should produce for a company at this maturity level.

**What drives the score:**
- **AI Governance (67.1)** — The relative bright spot. DG's SEC filings mention AI risk factors and governance structures, showing awareness even without execution. This is the "say" side of the say-do gap — DG talks about AI risk in filings but doesn't actually deploy AI.
- **Leadership Vision (51.5)** — Moderate scores from proxy statement analysis. Executives reference technology initiatives, but without the specificity or commitment level seen in tech companies.

**Where it's weakest:**
- **Talent (3.2)** — The lowest single dimension score in the entire portfolio. Only 2 AI job postings detected with 0 unique AI skills. DG simply isn't hiring AI talent.
- **Culture (26.1)** — A 2.64/5.0 Glassdoor rating reflects an operationally-focused, cost-conscious work environment. Innovation, experimentation, and data literacy are not cultural priorities.
- **Technology Stack (30.6)** — Minimal AI tooling. DG runs basic business systems without cloud ML platforms, data science environments, or MLOps infrastructure.

**Maximum concentration risk:** TC of 0.320 is the highest in the portfolio. Leadership_ratio of 0.5 means half of the (very few) AI-related roles are senior positions. Team_size_factor of 1.0 (the maximum) means the AI "team" is effectively one or two people. Skill_concentration of 1.0 means zero diversity in required skills. If one person leaves, DG's entire AI capability walks out the door.

**H^R context:** Despite being in retail (same sector as Walmart), DG's H^R (52.42) is lower than WMT's (57.58) because the negative position factor (−0.30) drags it down. DG isn't just in a sector with moderate AI expectations — it's trailing other retailers in adoption.

**The say-do gap quantified:** DG's AI Governance score (67.1) is higher than GE's (58.7), yet its Org-AI-R is 7.73 points lower (38.89 vs 46.62). This perfectly illustrates the platform's purpose — SEC filing language alone (governance) doesn't determine AI readiness. External signals (hiring, tech stack, patents) expose the gap between what companies say and what they do.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI Jobs Detected | 2 |
| Unique Skills | 0 |
| Glassdoor Rating | 2.64 / 5.0 |
| TC Risk | 🔴 High (0.320) |

## Cross-Portfolio Insights

### 1. Talent Is the Single Biggest Differentiator

NVIDIA's Talent score (76.2) is **23× higher** than Dollar General's (3.2). No other dimension shows this magnitude of spread. AI readiness fundamentally starts with people — companies that hire AI talent broadly create distributed capability that scores higher across every other dimension.

| Ticker | Talent Score | AI Jobs | Unique Skills | TC |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|------|
| NVDA | 76.2 | 109 | 45 | 0.097 |
| JPM | 59.4 | 74 | 11 | 0.216 |
| WMT | 60.1 | 21 | 18 | 0.279 |
| GE | 14.2 | 8 | 8 | 0.302 |
| DG | 3.2 | 2 | 0 | 0.320 |

### 2. Culture Is the Universal Weakness

Even NVIDIA (70.7) — the #1 Best-Led Company on Glassdoor — scores lower on Culture than on 5 of its other 6 dimensions. The portfolio average for Culture (40.2) is 31.7 points below AI Governance (71.9). This is primarily a **measurement limitation**: employee reviews express cultural attributes in natural language ("great place to work", "innovative environment") rather than the technical keywords the rubric matches ("data-driven", "fail-fast", "experimental").

### 3. The Say-Do Gap Is Real and Measurable

The platform's core thesis — that SEC filings alone are unreliable indicators of AI readiness — is validated by the data:

| Company | AI Governance (Says) | Talent (Does) | Gap |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| DG | 67.1 | 3.2 | **63.9 pts** |
| GE | 58.7 | 14.2 | **44.5 pts** |
| WMT | 73.8 | 60.1 | 13.7 pts |
| JPM | 76.6 | 59.4 | 17.2 pts |
| NVDA | 83.4 | 76.2 | 7.2 pts |

Dollar General's governance-talent gap of 63.9 points is the starkest example: the company discusses AI risk in SEC filings (governance score 67.1) but has essentially zero AI talent (3.2). Without external signals, a filing-only assessment would dramatically overstate DG's AI readiness.

### 4. Sector Context Reshapes Internal Scores

Walmart and JPMorgan have nearly identical V^R scores (67.35 vs 67.26), but their Org-AI-R scores differ by 6.77 points (60.03 vs 66.80). The entire gap comes from H^R — different sectors have different AI adoption pressures, and market leaders within those sectors get additional positioning credit.

| Company | V^R | H^R | Gap Driver |
|---------|------|------|-----------|
| WMT | 67.35 | 57.58 | Retail timing=1.00, PF=+0.30 |
| JPM | 67.26 | 72.36 | FinSvc timing=1.05, PF=+0.50 |
| **Difference** | **−0.09** | **−14.78** | **H^R explains 100% of the Org-AI-R gap** |

### 5. Data Quality Is the Silent Killer

GE's initial scoring produced Org-AI-R of 39.74 (out of range) due to a single parsing bug — the SEC 10-K extractor captured table-of-contents entries instead of business content. After fixing one function (`_fallback_section_split`), GE rose to 46.62 (in range). The lesson: **pipeline reliability is as important as algorithmic sophistication**. A perfect formula produces garbage if fed garbage data.

### 6. Concentration Risk Tracks Inversely with AI Maturity

Companies with the strongest AI capability (low TC) have the highest Org-AI-R scores, and vice versa. This isn't circular — TC measures *how* capability is distributed, while dimensions measure *what* capability exists. The correlation validates that distributed AI teams build more resilient, higher-scoring organizations.

| TC Rank | Ticker | TC | Org-AI-R |
|---------|--------|------|----------|
| 1 (lowest risk) | NVDA | 0.097 | 85.26 |
| 2 | JPM | 0.216 | 66.80 |
| 3 | WMT | 0.279 | 60.03 |
| 4 | GE | 0.302 | 46.62 |
| 5 (highest risk) | DG | 0.320 | 38.89 |
