# AI READINESS SAY-DO GAP ANALYSIS
**Complete Company Scorecard & Methodology**

---

## METHODOLOGY: HOW WE CALCULATE THE SAY-DO GAP

The Say-Do Gap measures the alignment between what companies communicate about AI in their SEC filings versus their actual AI implementation activities.

---

### STEP 1: CALCULATE THE "SAY" METRIC (What Companies Claim)

We extract AI-related keywords from SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A):
- Count explicit AI mentions (keyword: "AI")
- Count Machine Learning mentions (keyword: "ML")
- **SAY Score = Total AI mentions + Total ML mentions**

**Additional Context - Broader Technology Terms Tracked:**

We also track related technology terms to understand the full scope of AI discourse:
- **Automation**: Process automation and workflow optimization mentions
- **Digital**: Digital transformation and digitization references
- **Cloud**: Cloud computing and infrastructure mentions

> **Note:** The SAY score focuses only on explicit AI/ML terms to maintain rigor, but the additional terms provide context for the company's overall technology narrative.

**Example:** ADP has 83 AI mentions + 18 ML mentions = 101 SAY Score  
(Additional context: 14 Automation, 67 Digital, 148 Cloud mentions)

---

### STEP 2: CALCULATE THE "DO" METRIC (What Companies Actually Do)

We measure actual AI implementation through the **Composite Score**, which aggregates four key signals:

1. **Technology Hiring Score**: Volume of AI/ML/Data Science job postings
2. **Innovation Activity Score**: AI-related patent filings and R&D activity
3. **Digital Presence Score**: AI technology stack and infrastructure deployment
4. **Leadership Signals Score**: Executive communications and AI governance indicators

The Composite Score provides a holistic view of real AI implementation across talent acquisition, innovation, infrastructure, and strategic commitment.

**Example:** ADP has a Composite Score of 11.78

---

### STEP 3: CALCULATE THE NORMALIZED SAY-DO GAP

**Formula:** `(SAY - DO) / max(SAY, DO)`

**Why Normalized Difference?**
1. Creates a consistent scale from -1 to +1 regardless of absolute values
2. Makes gaps comparable across companies of different sizes
3. Prevents distortion from extreme values

**Interpretation:**
- **POSITIVE VALUES (+0.20 to +1.00)**: "Over-promiser" - More talk than action
  - Example: +0.88 means 88% more communication than execution
  
- **NEGATIVE VALUES (-0.20 to -1.00)**: "Under-promiser" - More action than talk
  - Example: -0.45 means 45% more execution than communication
  
- **NEAR ZERO (-0.19 to +0.19)**: "Aligned" - Talk matches action
  - Example: +0.10 means nearly perfect balance

---

### STEP 4: RANK COMPANIES BY ALIGNMENT

Companies are ranked from most aligned (gap score closest to 0) to most misaligned (gap score furthest from 0).
- **Best performers**: Gap score closest to 0 (balanced communication and execution)
- **Concern areas**: Large positive gaps (over-promising without proportional action)
- **Positive signal**: Negative gaps (under-promising, letting actions speak louder)
